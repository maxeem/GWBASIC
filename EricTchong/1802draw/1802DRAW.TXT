Twenty years ago I built my first computer. It was an COSMAC ELF II
micro-computer which had only 256 bytes of RAM.
One of the first program that I entered via the hexadecimal keyboard
was the starship Enterprise graphics program.
On the screen we were amazed at what we saw. A still picture on the
screen. (Now we would get bored.)

This gave me the idea to make the 1802draw.exe program. I use this to
draw the good old starship. But the difference with the still picture
is that it now travels across the screen.

Procedure:
	- make your picture with 1802draw.exe
	- with 1802pic1.bas or 1802pic2.bas merge the 1802data.bas
	- save the 1802pic1/2.bas under your new filename
	- make an exe.file with QuickBasic 4.5

There is no instructions how to use the program. But it's very simple
and maybe if you want to add this to your program please feel free. I
had that before but I did not like it.

Use keys 1, 2 or 3 to change the way the picture appears and <Esc> to
exit the program.

Anyone knows how to turn this in an screen saver?

Enjoy the nostalgia.

Eric.
