Hello Roy;

This time I present first two brain teasers.
In digfun02.bas the program will search for
a nine-digit number using the digits 1-9,
using each digit only once.
The 9 digit number must be divisible by 9
The first 8 digits must be divisible by 8
The first 7 digits must be divisible by 7
The first 6 digits must be divisible by 6
The first 5 digits must be divisible by 5
The first 4 digits must be divisible by 4
The first 3 digits must be divisible by 3
The first 2 digits must be divisible by 2
Type a number if you want to see levels printed.
<Enter> will skip levels print.
Type a number to let the program search the number.
Press <Enter> for YOU to solve this brain teaser.

In digfungw.bas the program will search for 3 sets
of 4 numbers that will add to 26 and will show this at
the end of it's search in a map.
Now this was an old program written in TRS-80 basic.
It runs so slow that I thought that the listing was not
correct. I converted it to GW-BASIC and compiled it with
PowerBasic (digfungw.exe) and also in QuickBasic (digfunqb.exe)
And the winner is of course PowerBasic. The digfun.bas
is the TRS-80 basic listing for those who dare to run it
on a TRS80 Model I or III machine. Nice to report to me
how long it did to find the 3 sets. I did run it on my
David Keil's emulator in top speed and it found the numbers
in 42 minutes on a 2.4 GHZ PC.

And the last program is a drawing machine that gives you to be
a Rembrandt in pixels graphics in SCREEN one. Easy to use
with source code in GW-BASIC and exe files. There are some demo
txt files with those that I assembled as a humble Rembrandt.
Have fun with these 3 new programs.

Enjoy,
Eric
