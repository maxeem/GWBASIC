Hello Roy,
Here a nice fun game I transferred from TRS-80 basic to GW-BASIC.

Game of worms in Screen 1, listed 12-08-2005

   10 ' worms1.bas - Eric F. Tchong - FreeWare 2005
   20 GOTO 120 ' begin
   30 SAVE "worms1.bas",A:LIST-120
   40 GOTO 1170 ' print@ to locate
   50 GOTO 1210 ' get key
   60 GOTO 1270 ' centered text
   70 GOTO 1290 ' delay
   80 GOTO 1310 ' delay shoot
   90 GOTO 1330 ' slower
  100 GOTO 1360 ' faster

Let's enjoy this game where you have to guide your worm in a space of mazes you must try to avoid to become a champion.
Eric
