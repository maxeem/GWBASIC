Just finished a tantalizing game in GWBASIC. Zipfile contains exe, doc, bas, txt
plus readeric.txt files..

After surfing the internet, I found a very interesting game called
The French Military Game. It was written in java language. There
are different versions. One plays in expert mode and you can never win.
Another starts in a simple mode and becomes smarter by eliminating
bad moves. After a few games you can not win as the computer
also becomes an expert.

I decided to write it in simple GWBASIC. And I just keep it for the computer
to play always randomly. Now even kids get a chance to win. And parents
don't get stressed with this very popular educational game in French
military circles during and after the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1871.

In another version I would like to implement the become smarter mode. For
now it was a challenge to write it in random GWBASIC code.

Have fun.
