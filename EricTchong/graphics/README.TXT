Hello Roy;

Some 8 years ago I bought some good old graphics GWBasic and QuickBasic books at a second hand book store.
I finally got a rythmic dip to delve into this software. Most were written for GWBasic and QuickBasic.
I took the time to streamline all these separate programs into menu driven programs using mostly screen 9. From my friend Hans Lauwerier's programs I took the pleasure of converting them from QuickBasic to run in GwBasic. However almost all has been
compiled using PowerBasic and screen 12 for VGA screens.
Upon request I have now also included the 640 x 480 pixels Squot program which runs in VGA mode. I still have to explore this for beautiful patterns.
So if you like fractals like Julia and Mandelbrot then here are 25 graphics programs compiled into 7 separate exe, bas files, where you certainly will find a demo of your interest.

Enjoy,
Eric Tchong
