Hello Roy,

Here my fifth set of freeware basic creations.

1. Android. In this game (Android Picture Gallery) you can play the simple game where you have to clear the gallery for the exhibition. In the full game you have to put androids in all the given frames These 31 full games are really difficult. I stil did not manage to solve them all. I would greatly appreciate that those who solve them all can send me the solutions at our forum. I have included a word file where you can see all the 31 full games.
Maybe someone can modify Android.bas so that it will show you the solution of the 31 full games.

2. Bigtype. Ever wanted a mini wordprocessor where you can put giant characters on your screen in a few seconds? Than this program will do the job. On your screen you can leave messages like: Out for lunch. Will be back at 14.13 pm. Even in different colors.


3. Droidnim. A spectacular game with lots of animations. You have to try to win by shooting the last android from 3 given rows. The computer will win if you do not find the strategy. A gigantic program which I managed to convert to GW-BASIC and using tricks from the school of Tom McIntire.

4. Listdisk GOLD. It is with this program that all basic txt files are made. Today where LLIST or LPRINT won't work without using special shareware programs I love to use listdisk. It gives you nice formatted listings of bas files saved in ASCII form. It automatically insert a blank line where you have remarks done with '. Line numbers are perfectly aligned. Extreme long lines are nicely put on a different line. The txt files I do read mostly with Word when there are graphics characters as Word has no problem with importing txt files and displaying them correctly on the screen. Why WordPerfect can not do this correctly is still a mystery to me. Congrats for Microsoft. With the Function Keys you can preview, set your right margin from 80 to 132, put a header, assemble a formatted listings and quit the program. As I like to read my source listings I can even debug and streamline my basic programs without to be at a computer. Please look at the doc files included in this set.

5. Wordpuzz is a great tool for designing word search puzzles. You can save your puzzle as a txt file. Read it with your favorite wordprocessor. And make beautiful printings.

Enjoy.
