10 th set Free Ware 2004

Hello Roy;

Here is my 10th set of freeware. I do a lot of searching to get the best freeware assembled.

Dicegame.bas is for those who really like to win from the computer. Try to be the first one to reach 31 or let the computer go over it then you are the winner. Easy to lose but you can always win when you find the logic behind this game.

Ascisort.bas How fast can my computer sort 2000 items using 8 different sorint algorythms? Easy to find out using this program. You can get a written report of all these sorting routines. Included are ascisopb.exe, compiled with PowerBasic 3.2 and ascisoqb.exe, compiled with QuickBasic 4.5 You will see that powerbasic will do it faster than QuickBasic. The shaker routine will shake up your monitor. Also included are my results in GW-BASIC, Quick- and PowerBasic with my homebuilt 2.8 GHz computer.

Factor18.bas is for those who asked me a 18 digits factors + divisors calculator. Now only PowerBasic can work with 18 digis precision. You can convert this program easily to 16 digits precision. But look out as 
                         16    16
9 999 999 999 999 999 = 2   * 5   is BAD as it's a rouding off error in QuickBasic. GW-BASIC and PowerBasic will factor it correctly.

Rootcal.bas let's you get any root of a positive number. Great for those who do not want to do it by hand or calculator like me.

Visisort.bas is a request for those who wants to vertically sort 25 items. So here it is with slow, bubble, shaker, delayed replacement, insertion, binary, shell and quick sort routines.

Enjoy!!!
