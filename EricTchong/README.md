http://web.archive.org/web/20060925154649/http://www.scottserver.net/basically/tchong.html#new


Each download has the compiled program, source code and any auxiliary files.


## UTILITIES & DEMOS  

##### 1802 Draw Program `1802draw`  
In honor of my first 1802 RCA 8 bit microproccessor based computer I
programmed a little draw program that let's you design a little mini
screen saver in DOS which still works in Windows XP.  
I include 2 examples in the `gwbasci1.exe` and the `gwbasic2.exe`. 1 for
screen1 and 2 for screen2.  
Press 1, 2 or 3 for different layouts and `Esc` will quit this little
screen saver. There are two text files that inform you how to draw your
own designs and how to use the screen saver.  

##### ASCII Sorting Demo `ascisort`  
`Ascisort.bas`; How fast can my computer sort 2000 items using 8 different
sort routines? Easy to find out using this program. You can get a
written report of all these sorting routines. Included are `ascisopb.exe`,
compiled with PowerBasic 3.2 and `ascisoqb.exe`, compiled with QuickBasic
4.5 You will see that powerbasic is extremely faster than QuickBasic.
The shaker routine will shake up but not damage your monitor. Also
included are my results in GW-BASIC, Quick- and PowerBasic with my
homebuilt 2.8 GHz computer. In GW-BASIC I do get a temporarily delay. If
anyone can fix this please let me know.  

##### BASIC File Compression `compexap`  
`compexap.bas` is one of the last bas file utility that appeared in 80
Micro before it disappeared in 1988. An excellent utility where you can
expand an ascii basfile or compress it. I have included 3 extra files
(`fraction.bas` `fractions.cmp` `fract.bas`) where you can see the results of
this utility that really works if you do exactly what I explain in the
`readme.txt` file.  

##### Big Clock `bigclock`  
`BIGCLOCK.bas` can never be missed. This is really a giant 4 digit digital
giant display clock. Nice for those who does not want to miss his or her
train, flight or metro. Nice to put it on your screen at the end of a
work day and you have only 5 minutes left to leave your office nice and
clean behind. It is furnished with source code and help included in the
program.  

##### Bigtype `bigtype`  
Ever wanted a mini wordprocessor where you can put giant characters on
your screen in a few seconds? Then this program will do the job. On your
screen you can leave messages like: Out for lunch. Will be back at 14.13
pm. Even in different colors.  

##### Circlock `circlock`  
`Circlock.bas` is a strange digital clock. The way it displays it's digits
are fascinating and may lead to those interesting in designing some new
kind of weird digital clocks. The accuracy of this clock has not been
investigated. Those who wants to improve on that please be my guest. It
looks interesting to make a digital counter from this source bas
listing.  

##### Cube Root Generator `cuberoot`  
This program generates cube roots either automatically as a demo or
manually allows you to feed in the number wanted. This is a compiled
BASIC program. It is furnished with source code and help included in the
program.  

##### Curve Plot `curvplot`  
`CURVPLOT.bas` is a cocktail mixture of 9 math graphics plot programs
brought all together in one program. It's menu driven and some have
enough data examples for beautiful astroid, bernouilli, bowditch,
caridiod, hypocycloid, rhodonea etc. It is furnished with source code
and help included in the program.  

##### Digital Fun `digifun`  
This time I present first two brain teasers. In digfun02.bas the program
will search for a nine-digit number using the digits 1-9, using each
digit only once. The 9 digit number must be divisible by 9 The first 8
digits must be divisible by 8 The first 7 digits must be divisible by 7
The first 6 digits must be divisible by 6 The first 5 digits must be
divisible by 5 The first 4 digits must be divisible by 4 The first 3
digits must be divisible by 3 The first 2 digits must be divisible by 2
Type a number if you want to see levels printed. will skip levels print.
Type a number to let the program search the number. Press for YOU to
solve this brain teaser.  

In `digfungw.bas` the program will search for 3 sets of 4 numbers that
will add to 26 and will show this at the end of it's search in a map.
Now this was an old program written in TRS-80 basic. It runs so slow
that I thought that the listing was not correct. I converted it to
GW-BASIC and compiled it with PowerBasic (`digfungw.exe`) and also in
QuickBasic (`digfunqb.exe`) And the winner is of course PowerBasic. The
`digfun.bas` is the TRS-80 basic listing for those who dare to run it on a
TRS80 Model I or III machine. Nice to report to me how long it did to
find the 3 sets. I did run it on my David Keil's emulator in top speed
and it found the numbers in 42 minutes on a 2.4 GHZ PC.  

And the last program is a drawing machine that gives you to be a
Rembrandt in pixels graphics in SCREEN one. Easy to use with source code
in GW-BASIC and exe files. There are some demo txt files with those that
I assembled as a humble Rembrandt.  

Have fun with these 3 new programs.  

##### Exponentiation and Factorials `multexp2`  
`Multexp2.bas` does also exponentiation and factorials. For instance if
you want to see: `52 2 52 2` it will print the results from 2 to 2 in just
a few seconds. As always you can keep the results in a `multexp2.asc`
file. Those asc files are also included in the zip files so you can
immediately see what it looks like. And the factorials are also fun to
see.

    40 != 815 915 283 247 897 734 345 611 269 596 115 894 272 000 000 000  

##### Factor--18 digits `factor18`  
`Factor18.bas` is for those who asked me a 18 digits factors + divisors
calculator. As you may know PowerBasic can work with 18 digits
precision. You can convert this program easily to 16 digits precision.
But look out as


                             16    16
        9 999 999 999 999 999 = 2   * 5   

is BAD as it's a rounds 9 999 999 999 999 999 to 10 000 000 000 000 000
in QuickBasic. GW-BASIC and PowerBasic have not this bug and will factor
it correctly.  

##### Factors and Divisors `factdivi`  
`Factdivi.bas` will compute the factors and divisors of a positive number
between 1 and 999999. Here an example of 1000. I did not type this as
factidivi.bas will do it for you and send it to factdivi.asc diskfile.
As a teacher I always love to do this type of programming.

                 3    3
     1000 = 2  * 5
     16 divisors
      1 * 1000     2 *  500     4 *  250     5 *  200     8 *  125   
     10 *  100    20 *   50    25 *   40

##### Fraction Calculator `fraction`  
This 4 function fraction calcultor is a compiled BASIC program and is
furnished with source code. Help is included in the program.  

##### General Division Generator `generdiv`  
This program generates division problems either automatically as a demo
or manually allows you to feed in the numbers wanted. This is a compiled
BASIC program. It is furnished with source code and help included in the
program.  

##### General Multiplication Generator `genermul`  
This program generates multiplication problems either automatically as a
demo or manually allows you to feed in the numbers wanted. This is a
compiled BASIC program. It is furnished with source code and help
included in the program.  

##### Giant 5 Function Calculator `16dpcalc`  
`16dpcalc.bas` is a 16 Digits Giant calculator with 5 functions. + -   * /
and v for square roots. It has a memory and also a constant function.
The digits are really big. I have used this one a lot with kids with
limited vision. As always I loved the challenge and the fun when
programming this one. It's so simple in use that anyone familiar with an
ordinary calculator will use this one with no extra instructions.  

##### Graphics Demos and Fun `graphics`  
Some 8 years ago I bought some good old graphics GWBasic and QuickBasic
books at a second hand book store. I finally got a rythmic dip to delve
into this software. Most were written for GWBasic and QuickBasic. I took
the time to streamline all these seperate programs into menu driven
programs using mostly screen 9. From my friend Hans Lauwerier's programs
I took the pleasure of converting them from QuickBasic to run in
GwBasic. However almost all have been compiled using PowerBasic and
screen 12 for VGA screens. Upon request I have now also included the 640
x 480 pixels Squot program which runs in VGA mode. I still have to
explore this for beautiful patterns. So if you like fractals like Julia
and Mandelbrot then here are 25 graphics programs compiled into 7
separate exe, bas files, where you certainly will find a demo of your
interest.  

##### Greatest Common Divisor `gcdlcm2`  
`GCDLCM2.bas` is for those who wants to see how the Greatest Common
Divisor is visually being sent to the screen and in how many steps it
did to reach that result. As a bonus it will also display the Least
Common Multiple. And you can as always save to a diskfile so you may
print it with notepad. It is furnished with source code and help
included in the program.  

##### Kalydo `kalydo`  
`Kalydo.bas` is a simple color generating dots program. The dots = pixels
all start from the center of the screen. Esc exits program. Enjoy
reading the source listing to learn some new tricks in graphics
programming.  

##### Listdisk GOLD `listdisk`  
It is with this program that all basic txt files are made. Today where
`LLIST` or `LPRINT` won't work without using special shareware programs I
love to use listdisk. It gives you nice formatted listings of bas files
saved in ASCII form. It automatically insert a blank line where you have
remarks done with '. Line numbers are perfectly aligned. Extreme long
lines are nicely put on a different line. The txt files I do read mostly
with Word when there are graphics characters as Word has no problem with
importing txt files and displaying them correctly on the screen. Why
WordPerfect can not do this correctly is still a mystery to me. Congrats
for Microsoft. With the Function Keys you can preview, set your right
margin from 80 to 132, put a header, assemble a formatted listings and
quit the program. As I like to read my source listings I can even debug
and streamline my basic programs without to be at a computer. Please
look at the doc files included in this set.  

##### Long Division `longdivp`  
`Longdivp.bas` is one of my favorite passtime. This program generates long
divisions puzzles, where you have to substitute the letters into numbers
of your choice. All puzzles are saved in an ascii file of your choice.
You can then select one of these problems and print them with your
wordprocessor and send them to your club newsletter. BTW I have added
also a secret key so that whenever these problems give you headache to
solve, you can peek at the dividend, divisor, quotient and remainder.
The secret key to peek is simple to find if you are willing to read the
source code.  

##### Long Multiplication `longmult`  
`Longmult.bas` is a multiplication program where you can use very, very
big numbers. You can save the results to the longmult.asc file. It shows
you the complete intermediate answers. Do you want to see really
gigantic multiplications then this is your first choice to explore. What
is `654789321456 * 502356987456123056741?`  

##### Magic Squares `magicsq`  
This magic square is really fascinating. They are the Merlin Magic 4x4
squares. All numbers from 41 up to 99999999 will be assembled in a
merlin magic square. In this version you will also see all possible
combinations in color. So finally anyone who needs a magic square of his
birth year can get one. All those basic programmers who may like the
color combinations feature in this program are cordially invited to
include this in my other magic square example programs. Enjoy doing
that. Don't hesitate to send them to me. In the magicsq.zip are all the
magic squares from the past and this new one that I have so far
programmed and explored. Don't forget that magic numbers may also be
your lucky numbers in the near future. Good Luck! Updated 1/31/05  

##### ]() ##### Mathematics Package `mathpack`.... NEW  
Although unfamiliar with Applesoft Basic, I managed to convert these
programs to GW-BASIC. A close look at the printouts of these
mathematical programs and due to well documented listings it was not
that difficult. As today `LPRINT` won't work without special programs, I
included the option to save all results to ASCII diskfiles, which you
can edit and print with your wordprocessor.

    59! =                                  1
                                          386
                                         83118
                                        5456898
                                       357379390
                                      19720389406
                                     3459028767726
                                    874325408212949
                                   40160000000000000

The first program factoril.bas will display factorials in a triangle.
Examples:  

           7 12 18 32 59 81 105 132 228 265 284 304 367 389 435 483 508
           697 726 944

A factorial can only be displayed in a triangle, if the total digits of the
factorial a perfect square is. 944! = 2401 digits. Square root of 2401 = 49. So
944! will fit in a triangle. I have limited factoril.bas though to 508!= 1156
digits, as factorial 508 will fit nice in a 25x80 characters DOS screen. But
you can edit the bas listing and see for yourself that the factorials 697, 726
and 977 are real triangles.

With the second program `factoria.bas` you can explore the above examples and see
the total digits of the factorial. You can then take the square root of these
factorials and find out that they will fit in a triangle. In `factoria.bas` you
may generate factorials from 1 to 508. Compiled with PowerBasic it just take a
few seconds to get 508! = .

The third program `factsrch.bas` will search all factorials from 1 to 1000 which
it's total digits a perfect square is. It is with this program that I found the
above examples 7 12 18 .. 944. Anyone who may improve the speed of this program
is cordially invited to do so. Please send me your improved program.

Finally it was an inmense pleasure to convert the last program `fracdeci.bas`
for this first New Year 2006 issue. A fraction to decimals converter which also
will display the total decimals generated, when the decimals are > 6. Here are
some examples to wet your appetite.

    1/3 = .(3)      22/5 =  4.4      1/7 = .(142857)      3/8 = .375
    45/56 = .803(571428)
     9 decimals

    11/59 = .(1864406779661016949152542372881355932203389830508474576271)
     58 decimals

As always included are source, txt, dat, and doc files to study these 4
programs closely. Enjoy and may our world benefit from these GW-BASIC programs.

##### Morse Code Program `morse`  
Samuel Morse left all radio hams from early days (today you do not have
to pass the morse code exam anymore) with a beautiful language to
communicate over the radio waves. Here I send you my morse program that
uses a very nice unknown algorithm to assemble the morse code using our
well-known ascii table.  
Also you may see the dits and dah's graphically shown in bars. This
option can also be swithed off. Enjoy the basic listing that still do a
nice job in Windows XP.  

##### Multiplication Tables `multtable`

This little story illustrates the power of GW-BASIC. A boss asks his secretary if she
could make a printout of the multiplication tables from 1 to 100.

All data should be correct and nicely put in beautiful aligned rows and columns.
And, he would like to receive this printout at the end of the day. Well she really
easily finished this task since when surfing on the internet she found on this website
the multi100.txt file which was made by GW-BASIC. She just used Word to convert this
file into a document that she finished before the end of the day. Her boss could not
believe his eyes and promised to raise her salary. Well that's what multi100.bas will
do and may the world be happy with this little time saver. BTW a doc file is also
included. Here a little preview of the tables 96 till 100.

     1 x 96 =  96   1 x 97 =  97   1 x 98 =  98   1 x 99 =  99   1 x 100 =  100  
     2 x 96 = 192   2 x 97 = 194   2 x 98 = 196   2 x 99 = 198   2 x 100 =  200  
     3 x 96 = 288   3 x 97 = 291   3 x 98 = 294   3 x 99 = 297   3 x 100 =  300  
     4 x 96 = 384   4 x 97 = 388   4 x 98 = 392   4 x 99 = 396   4 x 100 =  400  
     5 x 96 = 480   5 x 97 = 485   5 x 98 = 490   5 x 99 = 495   5 x 100 =  500  
     6 x 96 = 576   6 x 97 = 582   6 x 98 = 588   6 x 99 = 594   6 x 100 =  600  
     7 x 96 = 672   7 x 97 = 679   7 x 98 = 686   7 x 99 = 693   7 x 100 =  700  
     8 x 96 = 768   8 x 97 = 776   8 x 98 = 784   8 x 99 = 792   8 x 100 =  800  
     9 x 96 = 864   9 x 97 = 873   9 x 98 = 882   9 x 99 = 891   9 x 100 =  900  
    10 x 96 = 960  10 x 97 = 970  10 x 98 = 980  10 x 99 = 990  10 x 100 = 1000

Next is the trouble we may have converting Arabic numbers to Roman numerals and visa
versa. Arabroma.bas does this and the arabromd.bas will even show you how the conversion
of Roman to Arabic numerals takes place.

And finally the second and final part on graphics. All in GW-BASIC but be careful with
turtgrph.bas as this runs best in Quickbasic or PowerBasic as you will get a "string too
long" message in straight GW-BASIC. The program assembles a string of maximum 2388 characters
which is really to heavy for GW-BASIC. So if you like turtle graphics, Julia, Mandelbrot,
Mira fractals, the game of life in this section will surprise you and you will see that
GW-BASIC is still the super hero.

##### Root Calculator `rootcalc`  
`Rootcal.bas` let's you get any root of a positive number. Great for those
who do not want to do it by hand or calculator like me.  

##### Show Division `showdivi`  
`Showdiv.bas`. Although some months ago I send you genermul.bas where you
can generate various multiplications problems automatically, it was
showdivi.bas that was first designed historically. Some folks asked me
for a stand-alone long divisions demo program. I redesigned my good old
showdivi.bas and now will give you two styles to show you the solution
of a long division.


    Style 1)       1902               Style 2
                 ------           62 / 117932    1902
            62 ) 117932                 62
                  62                   ---
                 ---                    559
                  559                   558
                  558                   ---
                  ---                     132
                    132                   124
                    124                   ---
                    ---                     8

##### Sidesort XP Gold Demo `sidesort`  
This animated demo of various sorting techniques is a compiled BASIC
program and is furnished with source code. Help is included in the
program.  

##### Sidesort Platinum `sort99sh`  
This animated demo of various sorting techniques is a compiled BASIC
program and is furnished with source code. Help is included in the
program.  

##### Square Root `squaroot`  
This square root solver program will visually show you the solutions of
square roots. This is a compiled BASIC program. It is furnished with
source code and help included in the program.  

##### Squot640 Graphics Program `SQUOT640`  
Squot640 is a kaleidoscopic patterns generating program. Enter your
limits and see what kind of interesting (or not) pattern you get. A real
nice program for those who like to find the most beautiful patterns.
There are patterns where you will see jumping lines. You can even single
step to see how the algorithm of this program works. It would be nice if
in a forum people could send their most beautiful patterns. Instructions
are given in the program. Compiled BASIC with source code and an ASCII
print out of the program in a text file.  

This graphics program generates beautiful patterns on the screen using
four cursors who start their travel from each four corners of the
screen. This is a program that I also have programmed in Turbo Pascal.
If there is an interest I can also send this in a later package. This
program is originally a Z80 machine language program. This program was
so well documented that I managed to program it in GW-BASIC. It ran in
the past on TRS80 machines with those old black and white, yellow or
green monitors. Now you can enjoy it in 16 colors on your PC. Run this
program and try to find exceptionally beautiful patterns by using
different horizontal and vertical limits.  

##### Visible Sort Demo `visisort`  
Visisort.bas is a request for those who wants to vertically sort 25
items. So here it is with slow, bubble, shaker, delayed replacement,
insertion, binary, shell and quick sort routines. You can change the
speed to slowmotion or turbo. Also you can watch it in SCREEN 1 or
SCREEN 2.  


## GAMES & PUZZLES  

##### Android Picture Gallery `android`  
In this game (Android Picture Gallery) you can play the simple game
where you have to clear the gallery for the exhibition. In the full game
you have to put androids in all the given frames These 31 full games are
really difficult. I stil did not manage to solve them all. I would
greatly appreciate that those who solve them all can send me the
solutions at our forum. I have included a word file where you can see
all the 31 full games. Maybe someone can modify Android.bas so that it
will show you the solution of the 31 full games.  

##### Androids Game (new) `androids`  
`Androids.bas` is the new version of android.bas from an older set. I
invited the GW-BASIC family to design one which would show you the
solutions of a game. After a week and a half of healthy programming I
have now included the very first Androids game with auto solver. This
game is based on mathematical theory. So students are cordially invited
to study this game. With the auto solver it should relieve the stress of
not knowing how to solve some of those nasty, difficult games. Included
you will find txt and doc files so that anyone can study the source and
maybe come with a nice manuscript describing the mathematical strategy
of this game. There is also an androids.hlp file. The file is named
androids.bas as the s is for solutions.  

##### Ball Box Game `ballbox1`  
`Ballbox1.bas` is my little ball that travels into a universe and keeps
eating the corners of the squares he meets on his path. You can speed
him up in a very fast mode so that sometimes you will see that it is
entering a never ending loop where he will not be able to continue his
trip in the universe. This will be your lucky day as the ball will not
destroy our universe. I have included a ballbox1.qb source which is
different from the gw-basic program. QuickBasic runs the program at a
nice speed. But as soon you compile it to an exe file the ball will run
at an incredible speed and spoils the fun of watching the ball move. I'm
still looking for the best delay loop that will adjust itself with the
speed of micro-processors. Anyone who has such a marvellous subroutine
please let me know of it.  

##### Big Frogs Puzzle `BIGFROGS`  
Bigfrogs is a puzzle where you have to interchange 4 yellow frogs with 4
red frogs by jumping or sliding a frog. Instructions are given in the
program. Compiled BASIC with source code and an ASCII print out of the
program in a text file.  

##### Crooks and Mounties Puzzle `crooks`  
Ever since Jerry Fielden send me his puzzle Crooks/Mounties last year I
promised him to try to program it in GW-BASIC. I finally got some time
to do this. So here the remake of his puzzle. In my version even kids
can solve the puzzle as the computer just monitor your moves and if it's
bad it will advise by telling friendly: Rethink your move. The source
listing will be of much info for those to understand the solution and
the way to animate the boat going up or down. There is no mouse input
but simple use the 1, 2, 3, keys for Trusty, Crook, or Mounty. And the
Esc key is a fine panic button to immediately leave the game. As usual
the txt, bas, exe, and doc, files are included in the zip-file.  

##### Dice Game `dicegame`  
`Dicegame.bas` is for those who really like to win from the computer. Try
to be the first one to reach 31 or let the computer go over it then you
are the lucky winner. Easy to lose but you can win if you find the logic
behind this game.  

##### Dime Nickle Puzzle `DIMENICK`  
Dimenick is a sliding puzzle game where you have to make a penny to
interchange with a nickel. Instructions are given in the program.
Compiled BASIC with source code and an ASCII print out of the program in
a text file.  

##### Dime Penny Puzzle `DIMEPENY`  
Dimepeny is another sliding puzzle using the sliding and jumping
technique as in bigfrogs. Instructions are given in the program.
Compiled BASIC with source code and an ASCII print out of the program in
a text file.  

##### Droidnim Game `droidnim`  
A spectacular game with lots of animations. You have to try to win by
shooting the last android from 3 given rows. The computer will win if
you do not find the strategy. A gigantic program which I managed to
convert to GW-BASIC and using tricks from the school of Tom McIntire.  

##### Four In A Row Game `4row2004`  
`4row2004.bas` is the one kids love to play. You and your opponent can
play the game of 4 in a row, not against a computer where you might
always lose. Both opponenets have a fair chance to win. All in color and
very easy to play using the numbers 1-7 to drop a red or yellow chip
into a column. The winner is the one who has reached 4-in-a-row either
horizontally, vertically or diagonally.   --- As soon there is a
winner his chips will flash.  

##### French Military Game `frmigamr`  
After surfing the internet, I found a very interesting game called The
French Military Game. It was written in java language. There are
different versions. One plays in expert mode and you can never win.
Another starts in a simple mode and becomes smarter by eliminating bad
moves. After a few games you can not win as the computer also becomes an
expert.  

I decided to write it in simple GWBASIC. And I just keep it for the
computer to play always randomly. Now even kids get a chance to win. And
parents don't get stressed with this very popular educational game in
French military circles during and after the Franco-Prussian war of
1870-1871. Zipfile contains exe, doc, bas, txt plus readeric.txt
files..  

##### French Military Game (Smart Version) `frmigams`  
It does still play randomly but gives priority to smart moves. Also it
keeps track of how many plays has been done. A real win is considered to
be in 20 or less plays. As always the GW-BASIC program is full of
remarks so that anyone who wants to develop an expert version may do so.
Those who want to add mouse input routines please do so. Included in zip
are the bas, exe, txt and doc files.  

##### Hexapawn Game `hexapawn`  
This program lets you play a game, and the more you play it the smarter
the program becomes. There comes a time that it really is impossible to
win. The computer learns each time and will be the one who wins most of
the time.  

##### Kala Game `KALAGAME`  
Kalagame is an african game for two players, or one against the
computer. Finally you can really win from the computer as there has been
no AI used in the program. Instructions are given in the program.
Compiled BASIC with source code and an ASCII print out of the program in
a text file.  

##### Maxit Game `maxitnew`  
`Maxitnew.bas` a game that I still cannot figure out how to keep winning.
Remodeled for screen 9 and in color so you can see the negative and
positive numbers clearly. Please if you know the strategy how to win I
appreciate to know about it.  

##### Press Ups Game `pressups`  
`Pressups.bas` is a real challenge to win. Whoever has more blocks then
the opponent wins. Easy to play, hard to win. If you play a lot you can
easy find the strategy. Instructions in this program are even animated.  

##### Princeps Puzzle `PRINCEPS`  
Princeps is a puzzle that I have designed from an electronic project of
the good old days of Popular Electronics. Try to switch 8 lamps off by
pressing 8 keys in the proper sequence. It can be done in 170 steps. I
have also added a secret key that you have to find first to see the
complete solution of this puzzle. Instructions are given in the program.
Compiled BASIC with source code and an ASCII print out of the program in
a text file.  

##### Reverse Game `reverse`  
Here is a new design of an old timer. As I do work with kids with
limited vision I have designed a new REVERSE game with big 7*8 dot
matrix characters. Plus there is now a demo show included in the program
to understand what to do. The font is taken from TRS-80 character set
just to keep the old times alive. Enjoy. Updated 3/10/05  

##### Seven Coins Puzzle `7coins`  
Continuing in the puzzle category is here for the first time the 7 coins
puzzle. Try to put 7 coins on a star. Not knowing the trick you will
mostly end up with putting only 5 coins on the star. But with a computer
program you just hit R for restart and you can try your luck again. You
will soon in the future be able to get the strategy to solve one. Then
you should try again to get familiar with it so you can even solved it
without looking at the monitor screen. Enjoy this tricky puzzle.  

##### Tetris Game `tetris05`  
I'm happy that there is still interest for GW-BASIC. Here is tetris. Not
so spectacular like the one I played from Russia but you may learn from
my experience. 1460 ' In october 1992 Mr. Sjoerd Verweij published a
GW-BASIC listing 1470 ' of this game. Unfortunately it did not work due
to bugs. I left this 1480 ' program untouched for many years until I saw
the game "BLOKKEN" on 1490 ' BVN television (Is a combined Dutch/Belgium
TV on the cable). It looks 1500 ' familiar to this tetris game but more
in a quiz form. The last few weeks 1510 ' I started to fix the good old
source listing. After hours of debugging 1520 ' I streamlined the
listing and ended up in one of the best game written in 1530 ' GW-BASIC
by Mr. Sjoerd Verweij. Thanks - March 5, 2005 At the end of the basic
listing I honour Mr. Verweij. In 1992 I had not the time to go deep in
source debugging. Now it's the best time for healthy debugging. Enjoy
this addictive game.  

##### Word Search Design `wordpuzz`  
Wordpuzz is a great tool for designing word search puzzles. You can save
your puzzle as a txt file. Read it with your favorite wordprocessor. And
make beautiful printings.  

##### Worms `worms`

Here a nice fun game I transferred from TRS-80 basic to GW-BASIC.

Game of worms in Screen 1, listed 12-08-2005

       10 ' worms1.bas - Eric F. Tchong - FreeWare 2005
       20 GOTO 120 ' begin
       30 SAVE "worms1.bas",A:LIST-120
       40 GOTO 1170 ' print@ to locate
       50 GOTO 1210 ' get key
       60 GOTO 1270 ' centered text
       70 GOTO 1290 ' delay
       80 GOTO 1310 ' delay shoot
       90 GOTO 1330 ' slower
      100 GOTO 1360 ' faster

Let's enjoy this game where you have to guide your worm in a space of mazes
you must try to avoid to become a champion.

_Eric Tchong is a retired school teacher who lives on the beautiful
island of Aruba in the Caribbean. He began programming in BASIC on a
TRS-80 Model 1 in 1992. He later converted his programs to GW-BASIC on a
PC. He compiles his programs with PowerBasic DOS and Quick Basic. He has
now decided to share his programs with our members as freeware. I think
you will find his programs unique and very interesting. Eric says, "I do
think we are here at the only website where you still can obtain
GW-BASIC sources that may be of interest to all who want to get in touch
with the beautiful world of GW-BASIC"_
