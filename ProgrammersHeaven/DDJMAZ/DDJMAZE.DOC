     This BASIC program graphically demonstrates the method of solving mazes
given by Basem A. Nayfeh in "Cellular Automata for Solving Mazes" in the
February 1993 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal.  Basically, dead end rooms are
sealed off until there are no more.

     When prompted, supply an 8 (or fewer character) random number seed.
Different seeds will produce different mazes.  The mazes will have hexagonal
rooms.  After a maze is completed, you will hear a beep.  Press any key to
see the solution.  After the solution is displayed, you will hear a beep.
Press any key to exit.
