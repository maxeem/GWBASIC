    The following QuickBASIC 4.5 program will decompress and show most 256
color GIF pictures. It works much faster compiled than from the QuickBASIC
environment, but still, it is very slow compared to its machine language
brothers.
    The program was written for the 320x200x256 mode, but that can be easily
changed. All of the pixels are plotted with one subroutine- the PLOT
subprogram. (Don't forget to change the LINE (0,0)-(319,199),backgroung,BF
to whatever resolution mode your changing it to. For instance, in screen 12
you would change the (319,199) to (639,479).)
    The program doesn't handle interlaced pictures- mainly because I was too
lazy to implement it! Refer to the documentation for the GIF87a or GIF89a
protocol for full information on the GIF protocol.

(Note: The program also works fine with MS-DOS 5's QBASIC)
