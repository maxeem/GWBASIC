PLEASE READ THIS PAGE CAREFULLY.  It gives important ordering information.
Truly, I'm not doing this just to torture you!  Take a moment and look.

Depending on the product, registration may be done in any of three ways.
Some products can be registered through Public (software) Library, which
accepts credit cards, or CompuServe, which bills your account, as well as
directly through me (checks, money orders, and equivalents only).

Registration of a product entitles you to receive a disk or disks containing
the latest version of that product, as well as additional benefits.  Owners
may upgrade to later versions of a product at a reduced rate.  See the file
CATALOG.TXT for details on registration benefits and upgrade prices.  Update
notices are mailed periodically.  You may upgrade at any time-- there is no
penalty involved in skipping a few versions if it suits you to do so.

If you are interested in a product and would like to examine it further, you
can order a set of Sampler disks which contain the latest version.  See the
CATALOG.TXT file for a representative list of the contents of the Sampler.

All checks must be in U.S. funds drawn on U.S. banks.  If you are in another
country, consider an international money order, traveler's check, or cash.
You can reduce the overhead of any related charges by sending more than
immediately necessary, if you wish-- any overage will accrue as credit, and
may be used in the future for upgrades, etc.

For AsmWiz, BasWiz, PasWiz, and PBClone, credit card orders are now accepted
through the fine offices of the Public (software) Library.  If you wish to
register by MC, Visa, or American Express, call PsL at 1-800-2424-PSL or FAX
them at 1-713-524-6398. These numbers are for ORDERS ONLY.  For questions
about credit card orders, call PsL at 1-713-524-6394.  You can also mail
credit card orders to PsL at: P.O. Box 35705, Houston TX 77235-5705.  FOR
FASTEST SERVICE, include the item number:
   #10580  AsmWiz     #10581  BasWiz     #10582  PasWiz     #10387  PBClone

Registration can also be done through CompuServe if you have an account
there (GO SWREG to register).  Here are the registration I.D. numbers:
   #207  AsmWiz     #206  BasWiz     #208  PasWiz     #74  PBClone
   #209  PBWiz

Orders for upgrades or other products, as well as technical questions or
comments, should be directed to me at the address listed on the next page.

The Public (software) Library and CompuServe only process orders and are not
responsible for any other services related to my software.  Please contact me
directly for tech support.  The WHERE.BBS file lists ways of reaching me.

Please allow 2-3 weeks for delivery if you mail registrations directly to
me.  While I try to process registrations as quickly as possible, I employ a
mail drop in order to maintain a permanent address, and this imposes an
unavoidable delay.  Order through PsL or CompuServe for fastest service.

PRICES MAY CHANGE.  If your product is more than a year old, consider it
dated. Write for current prices or check with one of the BBSes listed in
WHERE.BBS for the current version.
