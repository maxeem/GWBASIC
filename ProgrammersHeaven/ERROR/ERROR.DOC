    BASIC error trapping
    February 1, 1987
    
    
    
    Have  you  ever written a BASIC program error trapping routine and then 
    sat  there  putting  in  stuff like IF ERR = 61 THEN PRINT "DISK FULL", 
    etc.?  It  can  go  on  and  on...  I spent a little time and created a 
    random  access  file  which  contains all of the error messages from my 
    DOS  manual.  Each record number is the number of the error. Now I tell 
    the  error  trapping  routine  to  open  the  error  file and print the 
    message found in record # err.
    
    In  this  archive  you  will  find  the  data file (ERROR.DAT), a BASIC 
    source  file showing an example of how to access the data (EXAMPLE.BAS) 
    and  a  program which will display the messages if you want to see them 
    (DEMO.EXE).  Everything  was  done for Microsoft's QuickBASIC, however, 
    add line numbers and it will work with interpreted BASIC.
    
    This  file is PUBLIC DOMAIN and has not been tested extensively, so let 
    me  know  if  you  encounter  any problems. In any case you are free to 
    copy or modify anything you like.
