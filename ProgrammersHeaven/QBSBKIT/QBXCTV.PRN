          QBXCTV   is   a  SoundBlaster(tm)   compatible   digitized  voice
          input/output module for  Microsoft QuickBASIC  4.x and BASIC  7.x
          compilers. Its purpose is to  provide digitized voice output  and
          input  for  my  QBXSBC  SoundBlaster/AdLib  music  card  software
          library but it can also be used separately.

          Features of QBXCTV are:

               1) Linkable module for stand-alone or environment (QLB) use.
               2) Written in fast and compact assembly code.  
               3) All 14 CT-VOICE.DRV functions supported.
               4) DMA transfers for background operation of voice input and
               output.
               5) All VOKXIT voice and packing formats supported.

          Syntax         stat = CTVport(port)

          Use            Configure QBXCTV  to the  base address  of the  IO
                         port used by the SBC.

          Example 1      stat = CTVport(&H220)

          Rules          The  possible  ports are  210h, 220h,  230h, 240h,
                         250h, or 260h,  selected via a jumper  on the SBC.
                         QBXCTV defaults to port address 220h.

          Notes          See  CTVSCAN.BAS  for  an  example  of  using this

          Example 1      stat = CTVirq(7)

          Rules          The  possible IRQs  are  2,  3,  5, or  7.  QBXCTV

          Example 1      stat = CTVdetect

          Rules          This function *MUST*  be called before any  of the
                         following functions.

          Notes          See  CTVSCAN.BAS  for  an  example  in using  this
                         routine.  CTVdetect()  requires  that   QBXCTV  be
                         configured with the  correct IO port and  IRQ line
                         used by the SBC. 

                         On the SBC is a DMA ENABLE JUMPER (DRQ1). Normally
                         this is  enabled. Since  the SBC  always uses  DMA
                         channel 1  you may be unable to use other hardware
                         devices that also use channel  1. It's much easier
                         removing the jumper  than the card. This  can also
                         affect  software -  PCBACKUP,  from Central  Point
                         Software, won't  work properly in  high-speed mode
                         unless you un-jump DRQ1.

          Return         0 okay
                         1 voice card fails (or obsolete hardware)
                         2 I/O R/W fails

                         module variable.
           
          Notes          Since QBXCTV  use background DMA  processing it is
                         possible for you to move  things around within the
                         QB environment while  QBXCTV is still  playing. If
                         the usrstat variable changes location, then QBXCTV
                         will be  updating an  unknown area  of memory.  An
                         alternate   but  slower  method   is  to  use  the
                         CTVstatus() function while in the environment.

          Type           FUNCTION - INTEGER

          Syntax         stat = CTVinput(SR,length&,vseg,voff)

          Use            Input length& bytes of voice data to the buffer at
                         vseg:voff  using  a sampling  rate  of SR  Hz. The
                         hardware does all  writing to RAM in  proper voice
                         file format.

          Example 1      DIM Buff(0 TO 24000) AS INTEGER
                         vseg = VARSEG(Buff(0)): voff = VARPTR(Buff(0))

                         stat = CTVuninstall

          Rules          Only one voice can  be played or input at  a time.
                         Sampling rate can be 4000Hz - 13000Hz. length& can
                         be any length&.  Time of  recording in seconds  is
                         length&/sampling rate.
           
          Notes          See  CTVIN.BAS  for  an  example  of   using  this
                         routine. When  this routine  is active  usrstat or
                         CTVstatus() return -1.
