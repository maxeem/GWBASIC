===== Information for Users ("READ-ME") ================

This package contains the AUDIO CD TOOKIT(tm) v1.00 for QuickBASIC, PDS
7.1, and VisualBASIC for DOS, by DSE Software Publishing.  This document
contains only a brief description of the package and its features, along
with instructions for its installation. Quite detailed documentation is
included in the package, but it is in archived form, and is more easily
read after installation.

AUDIO CD TOOBOX is a shareware program.  This evaluation version
includes all features of the program, and is not crippled in any way.
You may use it for up to 30 days, without charge (see ACDKIT.DOC for
more details).  If you like the program, and wish to continue its use
after this evaluation period, you are required to pay for the program
(see ORDER_ME.DOC for more details).  Any fee you may have paid to
others (disk vendors, dealers, etc.) to obtain this evaluation version
was a fee for their copying and distribution services, rather than a
payment for continued use of the program.

===== Installation =====================================

The installation procedure for AUDIO CD TOOLKIT is quite simple.  The
package includes a program, "INSTALL.EXE", which automates the entire
process.  You will need about 100k of available disk space on the hard
drive on which you plan to install AUDIO CD TOOLKIT.

The exact steps you need to take will depend on how you received
AUDIO CD TOOLKIT.


INSTALLING FROM DISKETTES

To install from diskette(s), you need to perform the following steps.

   o  Place AUDIO CD TOOLKIT distribution diskette "Disk 1" in the
      appropriate diskette drive.

   o  Execute the "INSTALL.EXE" program on the distribution diskette.
      For example, if the distribution diskette is on drive A:, type
      the MS-DOS command, "a:install".

   o  Follow the instructions presented by the installation program.
      You will have a chance to approve installation before any changes
      are actually made to the contents of your hard drive.  The program
      will ask you for a destination directory, and will copy the AUDIO
      CD TOOLKIT files to that directory. If you so direct it, the
      installation program will install executable programs and
      documentation in other directories of your choice.  It will make
      no other changes; specifically, it will not modify your
      autoexec.bat or config.sys files.


INSTALLING FROM A HARD DRIVE

If you downloaded AUDIO CD TOOLKIT from a BBS (or received it in the
form of archive files from some other source), you will need to perform
the following steps.

   o  Extract the contents of the archive file(s) in a temporary
      directory on your hard drive.  The procedure for doing this
      varies, depending on the form in which you received the package.
      In all likelihood, the fact that you are reading this text means
      that you already have the necessary tools and knowledge to perform
      this step.  If not, you should be able to obtain directions for
      this from the same source from which you received the package.

   o  Execute the "INSTALL.EXE" program which you have extracted.  For
      example, if the temporary directory into which you have extracted
      the AUDIO CD TOOLKIT package is C:\TEMPDIR, you would execute the
      MS-DOS command, "c:\tempdir\install".

   o  Follow the instructions presented by the installation program.
      You will have a chance to approve installation before any changes
      are actually made to the contents of your hard drive.  The program
      will ask you for a destination directory, and will copy the AUDIO
      CD TOOLKIT files to that directory.  If you so direct it, the
      installation program will install executable programs and
      documentation in other directories of your choice.  It will make
      no other changes; specifically, it will not modify your
      autoexec.bat or config.sys files.

When you're satisfied that the installation was successful, you should
delete the temporary directory FROM which you installed AUDIO CD TOOLKIT
(C:\TEMPDIR, in the above discussion), including all its contents.


YOU'RE READY TO GO

Once you've complete the installation, you should consult the documents
(filename extension "doc") which have been installed.
