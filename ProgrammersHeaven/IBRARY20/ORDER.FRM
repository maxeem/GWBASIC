PLEASE READ THIS PAGE CAREFULLY. It gives important ordering information.
Truly, I'm not doing this just to torture you! Take a moment and look.

Depending on the product, registration may be done in any of three ways. Some
products can be registered through Public (software) Library, which accepts
credit cards, or CompuServe, which bills your account, as well as directly
through me (checks, money orders, and equivalents only).

Registration of a product entitles you to receive a disk or disks containing
the latest version of that product, as well as additional benefits. Owners may
upgrade to later versions of a product at a reduced rate. See the CATALOG.TXT
file for details on registration benefits and upgrade prices. Update notices
are mailed periodically. You may upgrade at any time-- there is no penalty
involved in skipping a few versions if it suits you to do so.

If you are interested in a product and would like to examine it further, you
can order a set of Sampler disks which contain the latest version. See the
CATALOG.TXT file for a representative list of the contents of the Sampler.

All checks must be in U.S. funds drawn on U.S. banks. If you are in another
country, consider an international money order, traveler's check, or cash. You
can reduce the overhead of any related charges by sending more than necessary.
Any overage will accrue as credit, and may be used in the future for upgrades.

For AsmWiz, BasWiz, PasWiz, PBClone and PBWiz, credit card orders are now
accepted through the fine offices of the Public (software) Library. If you
wish to register by MC, Visa, or American Express, call PsL at 1-800-2424-PSL
or FAX them at 1-713-524-6398. These numbers are for ORDERS ONLY. For
questions about credit card orders, call PsL at 1-713-524-6394. You can also
mail credit card orders to PsL at: P.O. Box 35705, Houston TX 77235-5705. FOR
FASTEST SERVICE, include the item number:
 10580:AsmWiz   10581:BasWiz   10582:PasWiz   10387:PBClone   10816:PBWiz

Registration can also be done through CompuServe by automatic billing if you
have an account there (GO SWREG to register). Here are the I.D. numbers:
 207:AsmWiz   206:BasWiz   208:PasWiz   74:PBClone   209:PBWiz   1244:BCMD

Orders for upgrades or other products, as well as technical questions or
comments, should be directed to me at the address listed on the next page.

The Public (software) Library and CompuServe only process orders and are not
responsible for any other services related to my software. Please contact me
directly for tech support. The WHERE.BBS file lists ways of reaching me.

Please allow 2-3 weeks for delivery if you mail registrations directly to me.
While I try to process registrations as quickly as possible, I employ a mail
drop in order to maintain a permanent address, and this imposes an unavoidable
delay. Order through PsL or CompuServe for fastest service.

PRICES MAY CHANGE. If your product is more than a year old, consider it dated.
Write for current prices or check with one of the BBSes listed in WHERE.BBS.

DISCOUNTS ARE AVAILABLE when you order directly from me, when ordering in
quantities of at least 5 of an item (or multiple items of the same price). For
5, you may take 15% off; for 10, 25% off; for 25, 30% off; for 50, 35% off;
for 100, 40% off; for 250, 50% off; for 500, 60% off. Quantities of 10 or more
will be shipped as a single set of master disks with sufficient labels for you
to make an appropriate number of duplicates.

 BONUS! Through June 30, 1995, any registration (not the Sampler) gets you a
 discount certificate to buy the JCSM Shareware Collection CD-ROM at only
 $9.95 plus postage and handling. Please note that I do not sell this CD-ROM
 myself and can't take orders for it directly. Details and certificate(s) will
 be sent when you register any Hanlin software.
