
REGISTRATION
------------

        DOORFRAME represents many hours of programming and the author
deserves just compensation for his time, efforts and expertise.  If you
find this program to be of some value and you continue to use it, you must
return the registration form provided along with the registration fee. New
registrations are $35.00 plus a registered copy of each Door you write with
DOORFRAME. Please sign the form below acknowledging your acceptance of
these terms. Although DOORFRAME is not crippled in any way, it will display
an Evaluation Copy message until registered. Once registered, no messages
will be displayed.

        Registration entitles you to free upgrades via modem from The
Livewire BBS Support Conference. Payments should be made in the form of a
check or money order (do NOT send cash!). Foreign orders must be in U.S.
funds drawn on a U.S. bank.

        In order for me to get you registered in The Livewire BBS Support
Conference, you should log on to The Livewire BBS as soon as possible. Once
I receive your registration, your reg. number will be posted in a private
message to you on the Main Board.
