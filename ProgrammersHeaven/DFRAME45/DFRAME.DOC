    DOORFRAME is a subroutine library for developing online BBS Doors for
    systems that are compatible with PCBOARD.SYS, USERS.SYS, DOOR.SYS,
    CALLINFO.BBS, USERINFO.DAT, SFDOORS.DAT, GTUSER.DAT, TRIBBS.SYS, 
    or DORINFOx.DEF for interfacing to the BBS.

    DoorFrame was written for QUICKBASIC (tm) 4.5 and is not recommended for
    use with earlier versions of the compiler. DoorFrame also utilizes some of
    the routines contained in Tom Hanlin's PBClone library. The COM routines
    are handled by the QBSerial I/O library.

                             ====================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: 
Since the subroutines are DECLAREd in DFRAME.INC (you DID $INCLUDE: it didn't 
you?) you should not use the CALL statement. Type the name of the subroutine 
and list it's parameters (if any) without the enclosing parentheses.
For example:

DIS.PLAY MSG$, FG%, BG%, BLINK%, BELL%, XPOS%, YPOS%, NL%, CENTER%, CAPS%, CODES%

The FUNCTIONs still require the enclosing parentheses.

             GRAPHICS% variable will be set equal to -1 otherwise it is
             set to 0. This routine does not control whether COLOR is used
             or not, see the MODE% variable for that.


DOORFRAME v4.5 - Users Guide - Page 3

SUBROUTINE: 
DIS.PLAY MSG$,FG%,BG%,BLINK%,BELL%,XPOS%,YPOS%,NL%,CENTER%,CAPS%, CODES%
PARAMETERS: 
MSG$     - Text to be printed in either variable or quoted form. 
           Example: "Print this" or MSG$ = "Print this".
FG%      - Foreground color (0 - 15) Of the text. Can be in INTEGER number or
           INTEGER variable form. Example: FG% = 1, 1, BLUE (See Color Table)
BG%      - Background color (0 - 7) of text otherwise same as FG%
BLINK%   - Enter 1 for blinking text or 0 for normal text.
BELL%    - Enter 1 to sound a beep on the remote or 0 for no beep. Does not 
           beep on the local computer.
XPOS%    - Row number for cursor positioning. Valid numbers are 0 - 23 (status
           line is on 24 - 25). Enter 0 to disable.
           NOTE: XPOS% is ignored when GRAPHICS% = 0.
YPOS%    - Column number for cursor positioning. Valid numbers are 0 - 80.
           Enter 0 to disable. Accepts INTEGER number or INTEGER variable.
           NOTE: YPOS% is ignored when GRAPHICS% = 0.
NL%      - Enter 1 to send a CR/LF at the end of the line. Enter 0 to position
           the cursor after the last character.
CENTER%  - Enter 1 to center the line or 0 for no centering.
CAPS%    - Enter 1 to convert text to all uppercase. Enter -1 to convert text
           to all lowercase. Enter 0 for no case conversion.
CODES%   - 0 = No color codes in this statement.
           1 = Color codes are present in this statement.

DESCRIPTION: Displays text to both the Local (if on) and Remote screens.
             Accepts the full ASCII charcter set (0 - 255). Supports ANSI
             color and cursor positioning (XPOS%, YPOS%). DoorFrame features
             auto-ANSI detection and will display in graphics mode if it
             senses ANSI capability on the remote end.

ENHANCEMENTS: There are some special symbols available to make text blink
             in the middle of a line in any color you wish. For example:

             DIS.PLAY "This will %{Blink Yellow{", LWHITE, BLACK, 0, 0,......

             Note the {'s before and after Blink Yellow. They tell the routine
             to display the text in between in yellow and blinks because 
             of the % symbol. Without the % the text is displayed in yellow
             but does not blink. The rest of the line is displayed in white
             on black. The symbols and their corresponding colors are:
                ~ = Blue,  ` = Green,  @ = Cyan,  ^ = Red,  | = Magenta
                { = Yellow, and } = White 
             Put a * in front of the first symbol to display in low intensity
             colors. Ex: *}text} displays 'text' in low intensity white. And
             %*}test} displays 'text' in low intensity white and blinks.
             Please note that you must have called DETECT.ANSI before using
             these symbols and the caller must be ANSI capable. Multiple codes
             are allowed in one Dis.Play statement. See the included
             DFDEMO.BAS file for examples on using this option.
             If a particular Dis.Play statement does not contain any of these
             color codes, then the Codes% parameter should contain a 0. This
             will result in a significant increase in display speed since the
             routine doesn't have to search for and strip these characters.

DOORFRAME v4.5 - Users Guide - Page 4

SUBROUTINE: ENTER
PARAMETERS: None
DESCRIPTION: Outputs a "Press <ENTER> to Continue" prompt and waits for the
             response. If the caller is in graphics mode, this is centered
             on line 23. In non-graphics mode it is centered 2 lines below
             the last line printed.

FUNCTION: EXISTS (FILENAME$ + CHR$(0))
PARAMETERS: ASCIIZ Filename
DESCRIPTION: Checks to see if a file exists on disk. The passed parameter
             MUST be an ASCIIZ filename (FILENAME$ + CHR$(0)). The function
             returns 0 if the file exists or -1 if it does not.
             Example: IF EXISTS (MYFILE$ + CHR$(0)) = 0 THEN
                         PRINT "The file is there!"
                      ELSE
                         PRINT "File not found."
                      END IF

SUBROUTINE: EXIT.DOOR (YN$)
PARAMETERS: YN$, "Y", "N", "G"
DESCRIPTION: VERY IMPORTANT! Always call this subroutine as the last thing
             your program does. EXIT.DOOR updates the system files with any
             changes that have been made, closes the files, etc.
             You can toggle this ON, "Y" or OFF, "N" when you call EXIT.DOOR.
             If you wish to allow the caller to log off from your Door, call
             EXIT.DOOR "G". When you use EXIT.DOOR "G", DoorFrame returns a
             DOS Error Level of 1 for Wildcat! systems and 62 for all others.

SUBROUTINE: 
IN.PUT LENGTH%, WAITTIME&, IFG%, IBG%, AUTOCR%, Text$, TFG%, TBG%, X%, Y%, Show%
PARAMETERS: LENGTH%   - Desired length of input.  0 = any length.
            WAITTIME& - Number of seconds to wait for input. If ENTER is not
                        pressed before this times out, control is passed back
                        to the calling routine and RESPONSE$ will contain "-1"
            IFG%      - Foreground color of the response (INTEGER).
            IBG%      - Background color of the response (INTEGER).
            AUTOCR%   - 1 = Automatic CR, 0 = Wait for ENTER to be pressed.
            Text$     - Text to display (if any). Use "" for no display.
            TFG%      - Foreground color of Text$
            TBG%      - Background color of Text$
            X%        - X coordinate to display text. 0 = current coordinate.
            Y%        - Y coordinate to display text. 0 = current coordinate.
            Show%     - 0 = Don't display response, 1 = Display response.

DESCRIPTION: 
Gets a response from the caller which is returned in the variable RESPONSE$. 
Passes ASCII characters in the range 32 - 127 and ignores all others unless 
Hi.Ascii% = 1, in which case it accepts ASCII 32 - 255. IN.PUT also allows you
to use HOT KEYS! If you are prompting for a Y/N you could do something like:
   IN.PUT 1, 180, 12, 0, 1, "Is everything correct? (y/n) ", ,11, 0, 1, 1, 0
   IF UCASE$(RESPONSE$) = "Y" THEN      Etc., Etc.
As soon as the caller hit Y or N, the subroutine terminates without his having
to hit ENTER (however IN.PUT always returns when ENTER is pressed). The
response would not be displayed. The IN.PUT can also be used as a timed
routine. In the example above, The routine would wait for 180 seconds. if it
does not receive a keypress within that time, it returns to the calling routine
and RESPONSE$ would contain a "-1". IN.PUT features word-wrap ability in both
forward typing and while backspacing.

SUBROUTINE: INITIALIZE
PARAMETERS: None
DESCRIPTION: VERY IMPORTANT! You MUST make a call to INITIALIZE before your
             code does anything. This subroutine opens the system files and
             obtains all the information you will need to run your Door. It
             first reads the configuration file you passed on the command
             line, then it reads PCBOARD.SYS, PCBOARD.DAT, and USERS (for 
             PCBoard) or DOOR.SYS. There are 3 variables that must be
             populated before the call to INITIALIZE. 
                PROGNAME$ = "Name of your Door"
                EXENAME$ = "FILENAM"
                VERSION$ = " v0.0"
                INITIALIZE
             PROGNAME$ and VERSION$ are displayed on the Status line after
             the callers name. EXENAME$ must be populated if you plan to use
             the high score bulletin generator. EXENAME$ is the filename of
             your program minus the .EXE extension.
         ->  NOTE: EXENAME$ MUST BE NO MORE THAN 7 CHARACTERS!

SUBROUTINE: LINES (SROW%,SCOL%,LEN%,DIR$,ENDS%,MID%,EFG%,EBG%,MFG%,MBG%)
PARAMETERS: SROW%    - Row the line starts at. Valid numbers are 1 - 22.
                       Accepts an INTEGER number or variable.
            SCOL%    - Column the line starts at. Valid numbers are 1 - 79.
                       Accepts an INTEGER number or variable.
            LEN%     - Length of the line. Max. of 23 for vertical, 80 horiz.
                       Accepts an INTEGER number or variable.
            DIR$     - "H" = horizontal. "V" = vertical. Accepts a STRING
                       variable or quoted text.
            ENDS%    - If you are placing the line inside a box, you can
                       make the ends of the line match the box border.
                       Accepts an INTEGER number or variable.
                         0 = No ends. (straight line only)
                         1 = Single line.
                         2 = Double line.
            MID%     - Type of line. 1 = Single line. 2 = Double line.
                       Accepts an INTEGER number or variable.
            EFG%     - Foreground color of the ends (see color table).
                       Accepts an INTEGER number or variable.
            EBG%     - Background color of the ends (see color table).
                       Accepts an INTEGER number or variable.
            MFG%     - Foreground color of the line (see color table).
                       Accepts an INTEGER number or variable.
            MBG%     - Background color of the line (see color table).
                       Accepts an INTEGER number or variable.
DESCRIPTION: Draws either a vertical or horizontal line at the specified
             location. 

SUBROUTINE: MAKE.BLT (HI.SCORE&)
PARAMETERS: HI.SCORE&, 10, 10000, Etc.
DESCRIPTION: This routine will write a hi-score bulletin listing the top ten
             scores. The parameter passed must be a long integer (&). This
             routine creates a file called FILENAME.BUL. The first line of
             this .BUL file indicates the path to the actual BLT file. It
             initially writes FILENAME.BLT. If you wish to have a different
             filename (such as BLT1) you must edit this line. The filename
             for your BLT file should be 7 characters or less because
             DoorFrame also writes a graphics BLT and appends a G to the
             filename. (You should also explain this to your user Sysops!)

SUBROUTINE: MAKE.BLT.CURRENT (HI.SCORE&)
PARAMETERS: HI.SCORE&, 10, 10000, Etc.
DESCRIPTION: Same as MAKE.BLT except it posts CURRENT scores rather than
             highest scores.

SUBROUTINE: MORE
PARAMETERS: None
DESCRIPTION: Outputs "Press <ENTER> to continue, or <E> to end" and waits
             for a response. Check the variable RESPONSE$ for an "E" and
             terminate the current routine if found. For example:
                MORE
                IF UCASE$(RESPONSE$) = "E" THEN
                  Etc.. Etc.

SUBROUTINE: MUSIC (TUNE$)
PARAMETERS: MUSIC CODES
DESCRIPTION: Outputs music to the remote system. The TUNE$ parameter
             contains the same codes you would normally use in the BASIC
             PLAY statement. For example:
              TUNE$ = "t110 l8 ms d4 mn o3 g a b o4 c ... "
              MUSIC TUNE$
             Since not all communications programs can handle music, you
             should ask the user if he has music capabilities. If the
             user can't handle music he will simply see the music codes
             come across his screen (not a pretty sight!).

SUBROUTINE: OUT.PUT (LF%)
PARAMETERS: LF%, 1, 2, Etc.
DESCRIPTION: Outputs the specified number of CR/LF. Parameter is an INTEGER
             number or an INTEGER variable. Ex: OUT.PUT 2


SUBROUTINE: SEND (FILENAME$, YN%, CLR%)
PARAMETERS: FILENAME$ - STRING variable or quoted text of file to SEND.
            YN%       - 0 = Do not use the ENTER prompt after last page.
                        1 = Use the ENTER prompt after last page.
            CLR%      - 0 = Home cursor, do not clear screen.
                        1 = Normal clear screen.
DESCRIPTION: Sends the specified filename. This can be either an ASCII file
             or an ANSI file. SEND first checks for the existance of the file
             and either sends the file or reports "File not Found!". This is
             handy for displaying Help files, Welcome screens, etc.
       NOTE: When using The Draw to create ANSI screens, save the screen using
             the block mode (ALT-B) as this seems to produce better results
             than using the regular save function (ALT-S).




DOORFRAME v4.5 - Users Guide - Page 7

SUBROUTINE: SENDANSI (FILENAME$, YN%, INTER%)
PARAMETERS: FILENAME$ - STRING variable or quoted text of file to send.
            YN%       - 0 = Do not use the ENTER prompt after last page.
                        1 = Use the ENTER prompt after last page.
                        2 = Pause at end for Spacebar. Doesn't print anything
            INTER%    - 0 = User can interrupt and exit the screen anytime.
                        1 = User cannot interrupt file until it is finished.
DESCRIPTION: Sends the specified ANSI file if it exists. This routine does
             not stop until the entire file has been sent. Pressing the
             Spacebar during display aborts the file unless Inter% is set
             to 1.


SUBROUTINE: SHOW.BLT (YN$)
PARAMETERS: YN$, "Y", "N"
DESCRIPTION: Call this routine if your Door features a Hi-score bulletin. Make
             sure you have called MAKE.BLT first! Best place to call this
             is just before you call EXIT.DOOR. For example:
              MAKE.BLT HI.SCORE&
              SHOW.BLT "Y"
              EXIT.DOOR "Y"
             SHOW.BLT "Y" will ask if they want to see the Bulletin.
             SHOW.BLT "N" displays the bulletin without asking.

  .                                so you may add whatever is necessary.

NOTE: See Miscellaneous Notes for info on using Environment Variables.

NOTE: There are 2 additional lines necessary when using GTUSER.BBS. Since
      this file does not provide the ComPort% and NodeNum% variables, advise
      your Door users to add them to this .CFG file on lines 5 and 6
      respectively. Both variables will default to 1.

                                MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
                                ===================

Check DFRAME.INC for an explanation of variables not listed above.

DoorFrame requires DOS 3.x and up since all files are opened in SHARED mode.

When using PCBOARD.SYS, DoorFrame also accesses the USERS file.

When using USERS.SYS, DoorFrame also accesses PCBOARD.SYS, PCBOARD.DAT and the 
USERS file.

The DOOR.SYS used by DoorFrame is the standard 52 line GAP (tm) file.

The CALLINFO.BBS used by DoorFrame currently contains 36 lines.

Trapping errors
---------------
 If you wish to utilize the internal error trapping, insert the following
 line wherever you wish the trapping to begin. I would suggest putting it
 right after you call INITIALIZE.
   ON ERROR GOTO ERR.ROUTINE

 Then at the very end of your program insert the following:
   ERR.ROUTINE:
   ERRORS ERR, ERL
   END

 If ANY Basic error is encountered, it will branch to ERR.ROUTINE and call
 the ERRORS subroutine. The error will be printed to the screen and written
 to DFRAME.ERR. Your Door will then exit back to the BBS.

The first few lines of your Door should be:
   ' $INCLUDE: 'DFRAME.INC'
   PROGNAME$ = "Name of the Door"
   VERSION$ = " v1.0"
   EXENAME$ = "FILENAM"           <- NOTE: Max of 7 letters!
   TIMEOUT% = 240                 <- Numbers of seconds to wait for keyboard
                                     activity. 240 will wait for 4 minutes
                                     then send a Keyboard Timeout msg. and
                                     exit back to the BBS. Defaults to 300.
   OWNER$ = "Your Name"           <- For registered DoorFrame users only.
   SERIAL$ = "99999"              <- DoorFrame will display an EVALUATION
                                     COPY message until registered.
   INITIALIZE
   .
   .
   Your code.......
   .
   .
   MAKE.BLT HI.SCORE&            <- If you want one generated.
   SHOW.BLT                      <- If you want to show it before door closes.
   EXIT.DOOR "Y"

The configuration filename passed on the command line is OPENed as #1. This
file is left open so you may read additional lines from the .CNF file. 
Although it is not absolutely necessary, you should CLOSE #1 somewhere near
the start of your program.

Using SysopKeys%
----------------
By setting SysopKeys% = 1 (any point after calling INITIALIZE), you can
utilize the arrow keys for remote input. This could be used for moving
highlight bars etc. (see the DFDEMO for an example).  Using the arrow keys
from remote can present difficulties because the terminal program the caller
is using may have redefined the arrow keys. Qmodem is a good example. Normally 
the up arrow in Qmodem activates the scroll back buffer. However, if you switch
Qmodem into DoorWay mode (ALT =), the arrow keys can be used. I do not know
if this is possible with other terminals (feedback anyone?).  If you do
utilize the arrow keys, you would be wise to provide an alternative method
of input for those callers who cannot use their arrow keys.

In addition, set Sysopkeys% = 1 only when arrow input is required then
immediately set SysopKeys% = 0 since capital H, K, M, and P are also
interpreted as arrow keys when SysopKeys% = 1.

Turning off the Status lines.
-----------------------------
If for some reason you do not want the 2 Status lines at the bottom of the
screen to show, you may blank those out at any time with the following.

 No.Status% = 1
 ClrScrn Black

To turn the Status lines back on just set No.Status% = 0.

Returning control to programmer upon carrier loss
-------------------------------------------------
There may be instances where the programmer needs to do some clean-up when
a loss of carrier occurs before returning to the BBS. There are two variables
that allow you to do this. After calling INITIALIZE, set Auto.Recycle% = 0.
If carrier is lost, the variable NoCarrier% is set equal to 1. One way to 
handle this is to check NoCarrier% after each In.Put, Enter, or More 
statement. If NoCarrier% = 1, your door will NOT stop for user input. For
example:

   In.Put 0, 0, 11, 0, 1, "Prompt > ", 10, 1, 1
   IF NoCarrier% = 1 THEN GOTO HandleIt

If the door was sitting at the In.Put prompt when carrier loss occurred, it
would immediately come out of it and process the next statement. You must be
VERY CAREFUL when using this option. Make sure you TEST IT THOROUGHLY!!!

After you have done your clean-up, be sure to call Exit.Door "Y" to terminate
the door as you normally would.

System.File% Variable
---------------------
The value of System.File% will tell you which BBS file is being  used 
according to the following values:

        1 = PCBOARD.SYS                    6 = DORINFOx.DEF
        2 = USERS.SYS                      7 = SFDOORS.DAT                    
        3 = DOOR.SYS                       8 = USERINFO.DAT
        4 = CALLINFO.BBS                   9 = GTUSER.BBS
        5 = Not Used                      10 = TRIBBS.SYS

Fossil Driver Support
---------------------
DoorFrame supports the use of Fossil drivers.  To tell your Door to use the
Fossil driver instead of the standard COM ports, just put /FD on the command
line when running the door. For example:
     MYDOOR MYDOOR.CFG /FD
indicates that a Fossil driver is present and should be used. If no Fossil
driver is detected, DoorFrame will print a message to that effect and exit
the door gracefully.

Environment Variables
---------------------
DoorFrame supports COM 1-4 on the standard IRQ's - COM1/COM3 = IRQ4 and
COM2/COM4 = IRQ3. If you wish to use a non-standard IRQ, add the IRQ
number after the configuration filename. Let's assume your Door is
called FOOBAR and you want to use COM1 and IRQ5. The command line
passed to your Door would be:
    FOOBAR FOOBAR.CFG /5  or
    FOOBAR FOOBAR.CFG /%IRQ%  for the environment variable.
The /5 tells DoorFrame to use IRQ5 rather than the standard IRQ4 that
is normally used with COM1. No /x parameter is needed for the standard IRQ's.

When specifying the location of the system file on line 1 of the doors .CFG
file, you may use the environment variables %pcbdrive%, %pcbdir%, %pcbnode%,
and %wcnodeid%. Some examples:
 PCBoard: 
   USERS.SYS in C:\PCB           - %pcbdrive%%pcbdir%\USERS.SYS
   USERS.SYS in C:\PCB\NODE1     - %pcbdrive%%pcbdir%\NODE%pcbnode%\USERS.SYS

 Wildcat!:
   USERINFO.DAT in C:\WC\NODE1   - C:\WC\NODE%wcnodeid%

Non-PCBoard systems may use the PCB environment variables by setting them
in either AUTOEXEC.BAT or in the batch that runs the door. For example:
 SET PCBDRIVE=C:
 SET PCBDIR=\BBSDIR
 SET PCBNODE=1
