The two basic files are relatively the same except one is for PowerBasic 3.0
(SAMPDBPB.BAS) and the other is for QB45 (SAMPDBQB.BAS).  To run, just load
one of the other basic programs in its appropriate IDE and run or compile it.
The programs don't have a lot of documentation, but the variables and Sub
Procedures are pretty well self descriptive.  It is also assumed that you have
a working knowledge of either QB45 or PowerBasic. The programs let you create
a database whos size is limited by the size arrays you can use.  Once created,
you can ADD, EDIT, DELETE or PRINT records.  After deleting a record, the next
record added will be put in the spot the last deleted record occupied.  Have
fun and I hope they help.

Please feel free to upload these programs and README.TXT, unchanged, to any 
BBS in your area.  

YOU USE THESE PROGRAMS AT YOUR OWN RISK, they are for learning purposes only.
I have tested these programs on my computer, but I will not assume any
responsibility for any problems which may arise by using them.  If you
encounter a problem, please let me know about it, and I will do my best to
verify and repair the error.
