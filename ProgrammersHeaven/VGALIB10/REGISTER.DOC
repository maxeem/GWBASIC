_____     I have enclosed a check or money order for $39.95 (PA
          residents add 6% sales tax).  Please rush my registered
          version of VGALIB to the shipping address above.  (If I
          enclosed a check, I realize I will have to wait 1-3 weeks
          until the check clears before you'll send me my VGALIB).

          I realize that registration entitles me to:

               *    The VGALIB Library file, so I can compile my
                    programs without paying royalties.
               *    An updated manual.
               *    The source code and data files to those neat
                    demos that came with the demo copy.
               *    The Game Programming Tutorial to help me get
                    started on making my own games.
               *    Discounts on future versions of the library.
