I love this story!<BR>
Seeing Eye Dog (true story)<BR>
I was flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles.  By the time we took<BR>
off, there had been a 45-minute delay and everybody on board was<BR>
ticked.<BR>
Unexpectedly, we stopped in Sacramento on the way.  The flight<BR>
attendant explained that there would be another 45-minute delay, and<BR>
if we wanted to get off the aircraft, we would reboard in 30 minutes.<BR>
Everybody got off the plane except one gentleman who was blind.  I<BR>
noticed him as I walked by and could tell he had flown before because<BR>
his Seeing Eye dog lay quietly underneath the seats in front of him<BR>
throughout the entire flight.  I could also tell he had flown this<BR>
very flight before because the pilot approached him and, calling him<BR>
by name, said, "Keith, we're in Sacramento for almost an hour.<BR>
Would you like to get off and stretch your legs?"  Keith replied, "No<BR>
thanks, but maybe my dog would like to stretch his legs."<BR>
Picture this ... all the people in the gate area came to a completely<BR>
quiet standstill when they looked up and saw the pilot walk off the<BR>
plane with the Seeing Eye dog!  The pilot was even wearing<BR>
sunglasses.  People scattered.  They not only tried to change planes,<BR>
they also were trying to change airlines!<BR>
