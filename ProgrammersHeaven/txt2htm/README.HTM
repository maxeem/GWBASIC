TXT2HTM.EXE<BR>
Created by Robert Madewell<BR>
rbtmdl@email.com<BR>
Created with the MoonRock Compiler.<BR>
The MoonRock Compiler was created by Rowan Crowe.<BR>
Visit Rowan's website http://www.rowan.sensation.net.au/<BR>
You can download the MoonRock Compiler at his website.<BR>
<P>
The source code (TXT2HTM.MOO) is included in this package.<BR>
<P>
TXT2HTM is an idea that I've had for awhile. What I wanted was<BR>
a program to take plain text files and add HTML tags to them.<BR>
This makes it easy to add the contents of plain text files to<BR>
websites. While the HTML files this program creates are not<BR>
pretty by themselves, I can cut and paste the HTML code to<BR>
webpages. This makes typing the tags in the textfile unnessary.<BR>
<P>
There have been several earlier attempts. The best earlier version<BR>
was created with QBASIC. It still didn't offer the options that<BR>
this version does, and it was bigger (38k). This version is only<BR>
6962 bytes, about 7k. I wrote a C version that was over 60k after it<BR>
was compiled!<BR>
<P>
I tried to make TXT2HTM very flexible and easy to use. You should<BR>
be able to use it in Windows by simply dragging a text file and<BR>
dropping it on TXT2HTM, or a shortcut to TXT2HTM. You can also<BR>
use TXT2HTM as a commandline program in MS-DOS. As a commandline<BR>
program you can use the switches (options). This version has four<BR>
switches. Any number of them can be on at the same time. TXT2HTM<BR>
should work from anywhere, if it is placed in a path directory.<BR>
<P>
Here is the help screen that is printed when you enter TXT2HTM on<BR>
the MS-DOS command line.<BR>

Don't send me money, but email me if you like this program or if you<BR>
need help with it.<BR>
