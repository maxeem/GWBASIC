I love this story!

Seeing Eye Dog (true story)

I was flying from San Francisco to Los Angeles.  By the time we took
off, there had been a 45-minute delay and everybody on board was
ticked.





Unexpectedly, we stopped in Sacramento on the way.  The flight
attendant explained that there would be another 45-minute delay, and
if we wanted to get off the aircraft, we would reboard in 30 minutes.

Everybody got off the plane except one gentleman who was blind.  I
noticed him as I walked by and could tell he had flown before because
his Seeing Eye dog lay quietly underneath the seats in front of him
throughout the entire flight.  I could also tell he had flown this
very flight before because the pilot approached him and, calling him
by name, said, "Keith, we're in Sacramento for almost an hour.
Would you like to get off and stretch your legs?"  Keith replied, "No
thanks, but maybe my dog would like to stretch his legs."

Picture this ... all the people in the gate area came to a completely
quiet standstill when they looked up and saw the pilot walk off the
plane with the Seeing Eye dog!  The pilot was even wearing
sunglasses.  People scattered.  They not only tried to change planes,
they also were trying to change airlines!
