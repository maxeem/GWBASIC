1. Using the mouse and selecting tools or colors:

Basically if you know how to use Microsoft's version
of paint in windows this program will be far easier to
you. There are a few things to get used to with this paint
that would not be in the Windows Paint.

First of all there is no Undo procedure in this version
of Uniplex Piant, which would then mean that the carefullness
tooken in this program should really be high. And if you happen
to have a slow computer (of less than 200MHz) you may have to 
click on the colors or tools more than once to initialize them.

That is really it for this section of the manual except I must say
that I forgot to remove a portion used during my programming and if
you press any key of th keyboard while not adjusting a tool you
will exit the program. But otherwise it is great.

2.Adjusting the tools to best work for you:

I first put a few variations of tools into this program to
give you different types of graphics and possible texturing.
But they were all the same size and that soon became a problem
within my own personal use. So I then made it to where you can 
click on the button (blue) next to the size of the tool and then
be able to type in the amount. (All are limited to 150 pts).

Now most of these should have the option to resize but I must
remind you that this is an input and you must press enter after
typing in the setting. Once learned the feature is good.

3.Saving and Opening:

Uniplex Paint allows you to save an image of the paintable area
and during saving I would recommend that yo do not leave the mouse 
pointer over the area. But this will generate a Basic source
code file using the file name you have entered and have eveything
in the source code you need to generate this image. First of all
I know you are thinking "I wish the screen area was bigger" but
there is a small problem with that and that is that QBasic  can not
open a file of such size. But for a good graphical program this is
all you will need and to make the graphic bigger just use screen 13.

4.Using Qbasic and the format of Uniplex Paint:

Uniplex Paint will save the color of each pixel to a DATA item
this is long and stressfull but not to worry Uniplex Paint gets 
it all done for you. I, with my personal experience would recommend
using the GET procedure to save portions or the complete image into
the memory and then be easily accessed for faster and cleaner graphics.
If you have a way that you believe is better that I would recommend that
you use your way, but for starters my way is OK.


5.The advances of Qbasic programming with Uniplex Paint:

Basically Uniplex Paint generates image DATA that to be
done by hand would litterally be a Hell of a pointless thing
to do. Look at the length of the data in the source file that
you make then think of writing that by hand and it all be correctly 
set to create a perfect image. This is very painfull, I have been there
but never again. This is the best  way I could think to make images
in basic cause I don't have the procedures to generate BMP's or GIF's.
But This is even better cause no one can steal your logos ECT and you
can keep it all in one file. These images you generate with Uniplex
Paint are very good for Animation or objects in a game. See the examples
for some proof. (these examples are very simple). You could do better
and I would hope that you do. 

This program should be one thing to make Basic programming much more 
simpler and more effecient than C++ or Pascal. Really it doesn't get
much easier than this.

I myself hope that with the Free release of this program to help all
the Die Hard Qbasic programmers out there and help bring Qbasic
back out of the shadows. Don't Ever Give Up, That is the BASIC concept.

PS:
This is a DOS Program and has been successfully tested on a:
25MHz 386SX with 4MB RAM and 16-bit Video
        (A Calculator)
So Enjoy it and share it.....
