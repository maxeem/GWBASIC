         DEMO.TXT

         Included in this package are 4 demonstration programs, so
         that you can get a feel for how the libraries are used.  The
         sources are stored in text mode so they can be accessed with
         your favorite text processor (like 'more').  The executables
         are stand-alone; they don't need any of the QuickBASIC
         modules to run.

         DEMOATAN shows how functions in REALFUN can compute the
         inverse tangent, properly accounting for the quadrant in
         which the angle lies.  QuickBASIC's inverse tangent
         function, ATN, would give -0.7854 radians as the inverse
         tangent of -1, whereas REALFUN would give you -0.7854, or
         2.3562 radians, or -45 or 135 degrees, depending on what you
         want.

         DEMOTRIG runs through the gamut of the circular and
         hyperbolic trigonometric functions, tabulating the different
         values for different angles.

         DEMOJUL displays a Julia set fractal on a 320 x 200 x 256
         screen.  This program is slow, but is a powerful framework
         for "rolling-your-own" fractals.  To interrupt the program,
         hit any key.  The finished product is contained in
         DEMOJUL.GIF.

         DEMONEWT displays another type of fractal, that resulting
         from applying Newton's method to the equation z^4 = 1. 
         Again, this is not a quick program, but provides a framework
         for developing your own fractals.  To stop the program in
         mid-draw, hit any key.  The finished picture is NEWTON.GIF.
