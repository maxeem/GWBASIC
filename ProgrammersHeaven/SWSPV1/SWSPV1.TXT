Sprite is a full featured image editor utility that can make 
adding colorfull detailed images to Qbasic(r) possible. Sprite 
utilizes Mode 13 (320x200x256) and can edit multiple images at 
once up to 64 X 64 pixels in 256 colors. Because SPRITE can 
display and save multiple images at once, it is ideally suited 
for developing graphics for programs that require numerous small 
images, like those that are found in games.
 
SPRITE has an extensive array of editing tools that help make 
creating images quickly and easily. Pen, line, circle, box, 
fill, moves, flips, scaling, rotation, animation, re-sizing,
color editing and loading PCX files, are all part of 
SPRITEs aresonal. 

Creating images is only part of the story, though. Qbasic 
programs need a fast way to load and display images. 
SPRITE saves its files using the Qbasic statement BSAVE. 
Its counter statement BLOAD is the fastest file function 
Qbasic offers. Sprites are BLOADed into programs then displayed 
using the PUT graphics statement. PUT is the fastest graphic 
primitive statement provided in Qbasic and makes fast animation 
possible. The included Qbasic Demo programs demonstrate loading 
and displaying images, animating images and other useful concepts. 
 
Sprite also has features that make combining several sprite 
files, even files that contain images of different sizes, 
possible. If you have used an ealier version of SPRITE you know 
that there was no way to combine images from multiple sprite files. 
Now SPRITE has a function 'COPY FROM' that allows you to 'COPY' 
any image from another sprite file regardless of its image size.

SPRITE 2.0 is shareware. Documentation sprite.txt.
