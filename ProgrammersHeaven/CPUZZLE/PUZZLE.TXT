       Thanks for downloading QBasic Crossword Puzzle!

 This program is a mouse compatible crossword puzzle, as you may have 
already guessed. This is similar to QBasic Pieces, which you have
hopefully already downloaded. If so, you'll notice that QBasic Pieces
has a much nicer interface, but this was made 3 months ago, and it
was only 30,528 bytes uncompiled. If you encounter problems with the
clues showing up, the only thing you can do is run the mouse around
in the square until the clue pops up, but it should run fine.


     The two sound bites were made by some dude named LittleBug.

*********The newest additions to the M\K QBasic Library************

1) Ambush at South Range 2 : An excellent game, esp for QBasic, in
which your control a little dude and you like, blow up the school
after you "take care of" the teachers. Load \ Save feature, Sound
Blaster effects, and involving game play. Download today!

2) QBasic Pieces : Another excellent game, the second in the series of
fully mouse controlled games. This program is very addictive, with
5 puzzles each with 150 pieces and Load Save option. This also includes
a hall of fame that stores your fastest times. Another great game.

3) QBasic GRFX Demo : This graphics demo, utilizing our new graphics
saving method, displays pictures of real people and digitized artwork.
Each picture is loaded in about 2-3 seconds, and displayed pixel by pixel.
In the future watch for scaling and cropping effects.

4) Andross 2 : Space shooting game, with music as good if not better than
any QBasic program available on AOL. Details sketchy, though look for
well animated characters and arcade-style play.
