                         The Bard Collection II
                            PowerBASIC 2.1a

  What is The Bard Collection?

        The Bard Collection is group of routines for PowerBASIC 2.1a that I
        have completely tested.  Better yet, it is the Source Code! to all
        of those routines.
        Many of these routines can also be found in .PBU form in PB Tools.

        All machine langugage routines are converted using Rick Fothergill's
        conversion program.

        The source for all assembler files is included if available, and the
        author (if known) of each routine is given credit, as well as where I
        found the routine.

        If you have a routine or group of routines you would like to add to
        The Bard Collection, please contact me at 6438 Admiral Ave, Brooklyn
        Ca 11398 or on The Bard's Lair BBS at 718-381-3651.

Important!!

        Do not use any routines that you do not understand.  Many of the
        assembly routines manipulate different parts of your computer, as
        well as routines that use the CALL INTERRUPT statement.  These can
        cause unkown problems with your computer if not used properly!

        I take no responsibility for these routines, nor do I claim that they
        will do what you need.  If you use them, you do so at your own risk!
        Many of these routines are copyrighted by their respective authors
        so permission from said author may be needed for you to use them.
        This is your responsibility.  I include them only because I have
        found them posted on public BBS's or in the Public Library's of CIS.
