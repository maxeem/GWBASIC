Feel free to distribute LAND.ZIP to anyone you want.

LAND.ZIP should contain the files:

LAND.BAS       : BASIC program that generates landscapes
MAKECOM.BAT    : Batch program to make LAND.COM
LANDCOM.DAT    : Code portion of LAND.COM
PALETTE.DAT    : Palette information for LAND.COM
LAND.DAT       : Landscape picture for LAND.COM
LAND.COM       : COM program of a sample landscape

Intructions
~~~~~~~~~~~

 Put all files in a subdirectory. Run LAND.BAS from QBASIC. This will
 generate a LAND.DAT file. Run MAKECOM.BAT to create the final COM 
 program. Run LAND.COM to display the landscape.
