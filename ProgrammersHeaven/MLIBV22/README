        pages) type:
        
        A:>COPY MANUAL.DOC PRN 
        
        To run the demonstration programs you must:
        
        (1): Have an IBM PC/XT/AT/386 or compatible,  plus Microsoft 
             QuickBASIC 4.x or Visual Basic for MS-DOS.  Most of the 
             demo programs require a graphics mode;  you may need to  
             change  SCREEN 12  to another  graphics mode  that your 
             hardware is capable of displaying.

        IMPORTANT!     
        ==========
             
             If you are not using QuickBASIC 4.0 - 4.5  see "Getting 
             started" on page 2  of the manual  before trying to run 
             the demo  programs.  I have  tested this  library using 
             QuickBASIC 4.5 and Visual Basic for MS-DOS Professional,
             and everthing seems to work fine.  This library has not  
             been tested with BASIC 7x,  so if you  are  using  this 
             version and run into a problem, please let me know so I 
             can correct it.
        
        (2): Start the QuickBASIC editor by typing QB/L MLIBN
             
        
        (3): You are ready to load and run the demos.
             NOTE:  these demos are very simple little  programs and 
             do not show all the routines contained in MLIB.
