--------------------------

The POW! Toolbox is copyrighted, commercial software 
being distributed under the shareware (try before you buy) 
marketing concept.  It is not free software, nor is it in 
the public domain.

You are licensed to try POW! routines in your programs for 
a period of 60 days (two months).  You may not distribute 
programs that include POW! routines, either for pay or for 
free, without first registering POW!.  If at the end of 60 
days you decide not to register POW!, you should delete all 
copies of the program, including all executable files that 
contain POW! routines, and discontinue use.

Registered users of POW! will receive the following 
benefits:

* The latest version of POW! on floppy disk (specify 
  format, or 3 1/2", 1.44MB HD will be sent).  This 
  includes all files that came with the shareware 
  version, as well as the source code (see below).

* Complete assembly language source code to POW! routines 
  for ease of making modifications to the software.  This 
  is a major benefit, and one that is not offered with many 
  all assembly-language toolboxes.

* License to use POW! routines in programs intended for 
  distribution and/or sale, without payment of further 
  fees or royalties.  This is guaranteed in writing along 
  with your registered copy.

* Prompt notification of and access to major updates to 
  POW! for a negligible upgrade fee (currently $10.00 incl.
  P&H, subject to future change).  Minor updates and bug 
  fixes are always free with a postpaid disk mailer and 
  floppy disk.

* More demonstration programs, with tips and techniques on 
  using POW! routines.

* A collection of .VOC, .WAV and .CMF files for use with
  POW! or for any other use you wish.

* Technical support by mail and via the PowerBASIC BBS and 
  any other online services frequented by the author (see 
  the Bibliography section for an online reference)

You may also receive other benefits in addition to those 
stated above (which are guaranteed upon registration.  
Note that this is not a warrantee of any kind, but a 
guarantee of benefits upon payment of the registration fee.
