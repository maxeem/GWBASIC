Welcome to The BASIC Wizard's Library!  This is a library of routines written
in assembly language and BASIC for use with QuickBASIC and BASCOM compilers.
The non-registered version is for QuickBASIC 4.5 only.  Registration is $35.

BASWIZ provides advanced capabilities to your BASIC programs, including far
strings (no more running out of string space), a virtual windowing system,
telecommunications, file handling, pointers and memory management, graphics
(MDA, Hercules, CGA, EGA, MCGA, VGA, SuperVGA, matrix & laser printers), and
math support including fractions, BCD math, and an equation solver.

The virtual windowing system gives you a combination of both window routines
(pop-up, exploding and collapsing windows, etc) and a virtual screen handler.
This allows you to have much more information in a window than is actually
displayed at any one time.  Windows can be moved, resized, copied, and so on.

With BCD, you can handle large or small numbers to any degree of accuracy.

Graphics support includes new VGA modes: 320x400 or 360x480 with 256 colors!
