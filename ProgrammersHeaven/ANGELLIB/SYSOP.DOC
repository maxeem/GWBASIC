An extra-large-size Thank You for evaluating and helping me distribute
my software.  You have my attention any time you want to call, write, or
leave mail on a BBS listed in the docs.

I would like to extend an offer to register all of my shareware for $25.
I will send you a registered copy of each package on the disk type of your
choosing.  If you will contact me by mail, phone, or BBS and give me your
comments, suggestions, etc. I will continue to send updates to you as I am
able.

Please call or write with your comments.  I wrote the software, so I'm
in a pretty good position to take action on your suggestions! Thank you
for your support and feedback.  Remember to let me know your disk
preference & the printer you use.
