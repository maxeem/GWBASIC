I origionally copied this program from the August 87'(I believe.it's been a
while since i copied it) issue of Astronomy magazine.
 CLUSTER.BAS is a program that allows you to create Globular Star Clusters
and watch them evolve.Simple clusters ,with less than 10 stars,take only a
few minutes before you see lots of movement.More complex ones may take 15
or 20 minutes before you see much action.So start off simple at first

 In this archive file you should find:
CLUSTER.BAS-the program itself
BASMENU.BAS-a good menu program I found that works great to run any .bas
            programs from.
RUN.BAT-I'm diabled and hate to type so by entering RUN you run BASMENU.
CLUSTER.TXT-This small description.
You need to have these files,along with BASIC.EXE & BASICA.COM,in the same
DIR for them to work. I am using a Tandy 1000 & DOS 3.2 to run mine.

 Once you get to the main menu,in CLUSTER.BAS,to get started,pick #2 to
generate a random pattern of stars.You will be asked how many stars.To see
fast results pick a low number 1-10. Next enter the density.Again it's
best to stay low to see more action.10-30%
You will now find yourself back at the main menu.Choose #8,hit enter and
AWAY YOU GO.
 To stop the simulation hit the space bar and follow the instructions to
go back to the main menu.You can also enter multiple random patterns of
stars.Such as 5-stars/25%,5-stars/50%,10-stars/90% and then run it.

 There are a couple of bugs in the program.It does do most everything just
fine. You'll see.I don't know anything about basic programing or I would
fix the bugs.Someone who knows more probably can.

 Good luck and have fun.         Henry J. BLAIS           9/27/88
