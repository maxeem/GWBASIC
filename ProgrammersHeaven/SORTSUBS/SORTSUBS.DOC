        SortSubs is a handy utility for Spectra's PowerBASIC (all versions)
and Borland's Turbo BASIC that sorts your program's SUBs and FUNCTIONs in
alphabetical order, optionally letting you place dividers between each
SUB or FUNCTION for readability.  SortSubs is written for PowerBASIC 3.0,
but should be compilable under all versions of PowerBASIC.

        To use SortSubs, just enter SORTSUBS at the command line.  You
will be asked for the path to the directory containing the BASIC source
code file you wish to sort.  To use the current directory, press ENTER alone
at this prompt.  A directory of .BAS files (if any) in the selected directory
will be presented, and you'll be prompted for a filename.  Enter the name
of the program you wish to sort.  You'll also be asked if you wish to place
dividers between SUBs/FUNCTIONs to increase program readability (answer Y
for Yes or N for No).  SortSubs will then read through your program,
organizing each SUB and FUNCTION in alphabetical order, and placing all
non SUB/FUNCTION (main program) text toward the top of the program.  If you
selected Yes for dividers, a dividing line ('-----) will be placed between
each SUB and FUNCTION in the program.  SortSubs will rename the original
program to PROGRAMNAME.BAK, and rewrite the "new" sorted file to the 
original filename selected.

        I wrote SortSubs for my own use because I was finding that my
programs were becoming a jumble of SUBs and FUNCTIONs in no particular 
order, and it was getting very difficult to find a given routine.  
QuickBASIC automatically sorts routines in alphabetical order, but this 
feature is missing from PowerBASIC.  SortSubs will make your programs
much more readable, and make it a lot easier to find a particular routine
by paging through the program text.

        I'm releasing SortSubs as freeware, free for noncommercial use.
Commercial (business) use of SortSubs requires a licensing fee (write to
the address below for details).  If you find any bugs in SortSubs, PLEASE
write me at the address below so I can fix them - I'd hate to be blamed
for trashing anyone's programs <grin>.  Of course, I can take no liability
for damages arising from the use of SortSubs - you use it entirely at
your own risk.
