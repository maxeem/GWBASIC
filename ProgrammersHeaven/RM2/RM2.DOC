Û²±°   RMortis2 is finally out now!  (Yay, I knew you couldn't wait!  You °±²Û
Û²±° couldn't... could you?)  Soooo... heres a QUICK doc for those doc    °±²Û
Û²±° haters out there:                                                    °±²Û
Û²±°                                                                      °±²Û
Û²±° 1) Run QB  (Remember, it only works in 4.0 and above!)               °±²Û
Û²±° 2) Open RMORTIS2                                                     °±²Û
Û²±° 3) Press SHIFT+F5                                                    °±²Û
Û²±° 4) Still reading this?  Steps 1 thru 3 were the obvious parts!       °±²Û
Û²±° 5) Well, thats it.  Easy as 1-2-3-4, huh?  Hmm.. 4 isn't a step...   °±²Û
Û²±°                                                                      °±²Û
Û²±° SURGEON GENERALS WARNING:                                            °±²Û
Û²±° Your HP (Health Points) can only be lowered to a minimum of 1 point  °±²Û
Û²±° by attacks alone.  The only way you can be defeated is by missing    °±²Û
Û²±° the ball.  Why use attacks then?  It weakens them so it takes fewer  °±²Û
Û²±° times for them to miss the ball in order to defeat them.             °±²Û
Û²±°                                                                      °±²Û

Û²±°   whatever the password may be, and it will recognize it.            °±²Û

Û²±°   motion as you can get it.  Don't use one finger to press Away,     °±²Û                                                                                                                                           Also, theres two secret characters.
Û²±°   then press Down, then Towards... do it all at once using three     °±²Û                                                                                                                                           Type their name in at the character
Û²±°   different fingers!                                                 °±²Û                                                                                                                                           selection screen!
Û²±°                                                                      °±²Û
Û²±° ------(DAMAGE)------------------------------------------------------ °±²Û
Û²±°  A couple things to remember... The damage for each weapon/spell    °±²Û
Û²±°   is always constant (e.g. 40 DMG for C.Explode).  Damage will be    °±²Û
Û²±°   halved if the attackee is also a similar user (e.g. If a weapon    °±²Û
Û²±°   is used on a weapon user).  When you miss the ball, the damage is  °±²Û
Û²±°   not constant.  You take damage equivolent to 1/4 your MAXIMUM HP   °±²Û
Û²±°   (e.g.  You start with 100 HP and miss the ball, you lose 25 HP).   °±²Û
Û²±°   Essentially, no matter how much HP you have, either player would   °±²Û
Û²±°   take 4 misses to be defeated if no attacks were used.              °±²Û
Û²±°                                                                      °±²Û
Û²±° ------(STATS)------------------------------------------------------- °±²Û
Û²±°                                                                      °±²Û
Û²±°  HP stands for Health Points.  MP stands for Magic Points.          °±²Û
Û²±°  When you miss the ball or get hit by an attack, your health drops. °±²Û
Û²±°  When you cast a spell or use a weapon, your magic drops.           °±²Û
Û²±°  You can't use an attack without enough magic to do it.             °±²Û
Û²±°  Your HP can be lowered to a minimum of 1 by attacks alone.         °±²Û
Û²±°   Missing the ball is the only way to be defeated.                   °±²Û
Û²±°                                                                      °±²Û
