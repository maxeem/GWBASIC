Long Description:

     ASIC is a "BASIC" programming language compiler for IBM PCs and
compatibles.  It includes an integrated full screen editor, from which you
can edit, compile, and debug your programs.  Or, at your option, you can
use your own text editor, and compile your programs from the MS DOS command
line.  It supports over 80 BASIC statements, decimal, integer and string
variables and arrays.  It will compile your programs at high speed, and the
code it generates is fast and compact.  The syntax of each ASIC statement
is generally a valid subset of the syntax used by BASICA and GWBASIC.

                         Distribution Requirements

Shareware Distributors may charge a nominal fee for distribution of ASIC.
ASIC must be identified as shareware.  The term "shareware" must be
explained so that users know that ASIC is copyrighted and that an
additional fee must be paid if they use it.  This explanation should be
displayed so that all recipients of ASIC have the opportunity to read it
prior to obtaining ASIC.

Shareware Distributors must stop distributing copies of ASIC upon written
notification from 80/20 Software.

None of the ASIC files may be modified in any way.  All ASIC files must be
distributed together, although other files may be added.  The ASIC files
are:
