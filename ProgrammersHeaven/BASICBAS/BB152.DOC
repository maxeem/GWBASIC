		     BasicBasic Version 1.52 Summary
	  -------------------------------------------------------

	  BasicBasic is a Basic Language Program Development System
	  for DOS or Windows.  With it you can create programs to
	  run under DOS or Windows.  BasicBasic is an easy way to
	  develop small to medium size programs without regard for
	  which environment they will run under.

	  BasicBasic is a complete development system.  You can edit,
	  compile and run your program from its own editor.  Both DOS
	  and Windows systems are provided.

	  BasicBasic supports most 'standard' Basic commands as well
	  as many powerful statements unique to BasicBasic.  For
	  instance BasicBasic allows you to load and display Bitmap
	  graphic files with one statement--in DOS or Windows!
