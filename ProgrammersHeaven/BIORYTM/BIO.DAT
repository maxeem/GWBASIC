BIORHYTHM is the behavioral science of life-energy rhythms.  It is not
magic, astrology, nor mysticism.  There are many rhythms familiar to
all of us, such as:

    . day/night rhythms (24 hours)
    . seasonal rhythms (spring, summer, fall, winter)
    . annual rhythms (365.25 days per year)
    . lunar rhythms (cycles of the moon - 29.5 days)

Near the turn of the century, Dr. Hermann Swoboda of Vienna and a
German physician, Dr. Wilhelm Fliess identified three new rhythm
cycles.  These are the physical, emotional (sensitivity), and
intellectual life-energy cycles.

The physical cycle takes 23 days, the emotional (sensitivity) is 28
days long, and the intellectual, 33.  Theory states that at the moment
of birth, an internal biological clock starts with our first breath.

There is no bad news with biorhythms, just information.  Being down
in a cycle is not necessarily bad, and being up is not necessarily
good.  Therefore it is important to know exactly where we are daily on
each of the energy curves, because our energy systems seems to cut
back substantially at certain times.  These times are:


    .  CAUTION DAYS: curve crosses the "0" line.  This is referred to
       as a Critical day.

    .  MINI-CAUTION DAYS: days at the top of the cycles are usually
       potentially less difficult than the mini-caution days at the
       bottom of the curves.

    .  COMBINATION DAYS: any day which is simultaneously a Caution or
       Mini-Caution day in ANY combination of other Caution days.

    .  SEMI-CRITICAL DAYS: the two days immediately before and after a
       Critical day.

It is important to understand that any Caution or Mini-Caution or
Combination day is not destined to be a difficult day.  But the
probability is very strong that a person will most likely have a
sub-par day, in addition to being more subject to injury.

The following table expresses the three cycles:

ENERGY RELEASE (+)        CYCLE              ENERGY RECHARGE (-)

 days 2 thru 11          Physical              days 13 thru 23
 days 2 thru 14         Emotional              days 16 thru 28
 days 2 thru 16        Intellectual            days 18 thru 33


There are 21,252 different biorhythmic days in a person's life
(23x28x33).  Biorhythmically each day of our lives is different until
we pass the age of 58 when the cycles begin all over again.

A person born on a Monday will find that his most difficult day of the
week biorhythmically has been, and always will be throughout his entire
lifetime, Monday.  This is because the Emotional Cycle is exactly 28
days and is the only one of the three cycles which is evenly divisible
by 7 (days per week).  Therefore, the day of the week you were born on
is always a Caution or Mini-Caution day.

Recent research tends to indicate:

1) More sports injuries generally occur on biorhythmic Caution or
Mini-Caution days.  Combination days are particularly dangerous.

2) Births usually occur on or as an immediate result of the mother's
biorhythmic Caution, Mini-Caution, or Combination days.

3) People are often more irritable and tend to complain more on
Caution and/or Mini-Caution days.

4) That from an accident prevention standpoint, it is generally better
to be (-) physically ( because overconfidence is created when we are
at the top (+) of the physical curve), and not on either a Caution or
Mini-Caution day.
