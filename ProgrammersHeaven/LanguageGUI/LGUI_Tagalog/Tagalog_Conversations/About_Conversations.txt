The Conversations/Examples on this disk serve as Reading Material and/or
Examples only, as to how a conversation MIGHT be conducted.

Most words/sentences used are in the TAGALOG Files - For those that are not
you may need a TAGALOG Dictionary/Help from a Filipino simply because these
conversations/examples are looked upon as the Next_Learning_Level
(Easy-Medium) of TAGALOG.

The Conversations/Examples have been written in a way that I would express
myself when talking to a Filipino. In other words. If I was talking on the
phone with a 100% Filipino voice you would still know I was not a Filipino
because of my use of words and way of thinking. This is only with regards
to the conversation/example files. Obviously I would express myself better
in English. The Tagalog files are from a Filipino's way of thinking/talking
because they were originally created from looking at Books and listening to
Tapes and then given improvement/better translation by my Filipino friends.
The English files, once created (from the original tagalog files, as mentioned
above), were given improvement/better translation by myself to represent the
English way of thinking/talking. Thus, the Tagalog and English files should be
an accurate representation of both Languages.
