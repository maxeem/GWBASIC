AutoClock v1.0 - Digital Clock Routine For QuickBasic 4.5
Written By Robert L. Folmer - Lightning Software 11/02/92
---------------------------------------------------------

AutoClock is a simple QuickBasic 4.5 routine that can be used as a sub
routine or compiled and shelled to from your program. When run AutoClock
places a digital clock centered on the screen and will abort if a key
is pressed, the clock will continue to display the current time until
the program is exited. The complete source code (about 9 lines) has been
included along with the executable version. The archive should contain
the following files:

AUTOCLK.BAS - ASCII QuickBasic 4.5 source code for AutoClock
AUTOCLK.EXE - Executable of AUTOCLK.BAS - to begin type AUTOCLK
README.DOC  - This file!
FILE_ID.DIZ - Imbedded description file
DESC.SDI    - Imbedded description file

When distributing AutoClock please be sure all of the above files have
been enclosed.

Although this routine is very small, it's an excellent programming example
for using WHILE...WEND...DO...LOOP statements.

NOTE: The program is setup to display in EGA mode 7, if using on any other
      display adapter remember to change the "SCREEN" statement contained
      in AUTOCLK.BAS.

I am releasing this program into the public domain, you may freely copy,
distribute and incorporate the routine in your own program so long that
no fee is charged for the program itself. All questions and comments are
