       DEFINITION OF SHAREWARE


            Shareware distribution gives users a chance to try software
       before buying it.  If you try a Shareware program and continue using
       it, you are expected to register.  Individual programs differ on
       details -- some request registration while others require it, some
       specify a maximum trial period.  With registration, you get anything
       from the simple right to continue using the software to an updated
       program with printed manual.

            Copyright laws apply to both Shareware and commercial software,
       and the copyright holder retains all rights, with a few specific
       exceptions as stated below.  Shareware authors are accomplished
       programmers, just like commercial authors, and the programs are of
       comparable quality.  (In both cases, there are good programs and bad
       ones!) The main difference is in the method of distribution.  The
       author specifically grants the right to copy and distribute the
       software, either to all and sundry or to a specific group.  For
       example, some authors require written permission before a commercial
       disk vendor may copy their Shareware.

            Shareware is a distribution method, not a type of software.  You
       should find software that suits your needs and pocketbook, whether
       it's commercial or Shareware.  The Shareware system makes fitting your
       needs easier, because you can try before you buy. And because the
       overhead is low, prices are low also.  Shareware has the ultimate
       money-back guarantee -- if you don't use the product, you don't pay
       for it.


       SHAREWARE DISCLAIMER - AGREEMENT


            Users of BARCODES-LITE must accept this disclaimer of warranty:

            BARCODES-LITE is supplied as is.  This author disclaims all
       warranties, expressed or implied, including without limitation, the
       warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose. The
       author assumes no liability for damages, direct or consequential,
       which may result from the use of BARCODES-LITE.

            BARCODES-LITE is a "shareware program" and is provided at no
       charge to the user for evaluation.  Feel free to share it with your
       friends, but do not give it away altered or as part of another system.
       The essence of "user-supported" software is to provide micro computer
       users with quality software without high prices, and yet to provide
       incentives for programmers to continue to develop new products.  If
       you find BARCODES-LITE useful and that you are continuing to use
       BARCODES-LITE after a trial period of 30 days, you must make a
       registration payment of $ 100.00 to GRAFTech.  The registration fee
       will license one copy for use on any one computer at any one time.
       You must treat this software just like a book.  An example is that
       this software may be used by any number of people and may be freely

       moved from one computer to another, so long as there is no possibility
       of it being used at one location while it's being used at another.
       Just as a book cannot be read by two different persons at the same
       time.

            Commercial users of BARCODES-LITE must register and pay for their
       copies within 30 days of first use or their license is withdrawn.
       Site-License agreements may be made by contacting GRAFTech.

            Anyone distributing BARCODES-LITE for any kind of remuneration
       must first contact GRAFTech at Post Office Box 851228, Westland  MI
       USA  48185-6328, for authorization.  This authorization will be
       automatically granted to distributors recognized by the (ASP) as
       adhering to its guidelines for shareware distributors, and such
       distributors may begin offering BARCODES-LITE immediately (However
       GRAFTech must still be advised so that the distributor can be kept
       up-to-date with the latest version of BARCODES-LITE.).

            You are encouraged to pass a copy of BARCODES-LITE along to your
       friends for evaluation.  Please encourage them to register their copy
       if they find that they can use it.  All registered users will receive
       a copy of the latest version of BARCODES-LITE.

       INTRODUCTION


            Since 1988, BARCODES-PLUS has been providing developers and end
       users with the ability to produce high quality bar codes without the
       need for expensive specialized bar code printers.

            Today, BARCODES-PLUS is used by developers and end users around
       the world.  More than simple cost effectiveness, these users recognize
       the power and versatility of having portable bar code technology built
       into their business applications.

            Now GRAFTech has taken cost effective bar coding one step
       further, by introducing BARCODES-LITE, with many of the features of
       BARCODES-PLUS and one third the price.

            Using the very same, easy to use, simplified call statements,
       BARCODES-LITE will print virtually all the bar codes you'll ever need.
       And, because we provide the complete source coding, you'll be able to
       take BARCODES-LITE with you no matter what basic language or operating
       system you use in the future.

            BARCODES-LITE brings business graphics into the 21st century.

            When you use BARCODES-LITE you will have the ability to use the
       graphic printers you probably already own, change printers, add new
       printers and use virtually every printer on your system without any
       further investment in bar code technology.

            No other software package or developers tool gives you this much
       power.

            BARCODES-LITE utilizes the standards established by:

            - Uniform Codes Council (UCC)
            - Automatic Identification Manufacturers (AIM)
            - United States Department of Defense (DOD)
            - American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
            - Intermec Corporation
            - International Article Numbering Association (EAN/IAN)
            - Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG)
            - National Association of Electrical Distributors (NAED)

       to give you the graphic edge you need to remain competitive in todays
       graphical business environment.

       DOCUMENTATION


            Although every effort has been made to make this documentation as
       complete and accurate as possible, some features may change, be
       deleted or be added to the actual programs, please check the sample
       programs included on the distribution disks for the latest list of
       features.


       NOTICES


            In an effort to provide you our users with the best possible
       product, GRAFTech reserves the right to change specifications,
       features, program structures and this documentation without notice.
       Further, to provide our users with the greatest possible number of
       supported printers and features, GRAFTech may update the actual
       programs without making documentation changes until such time as a
       formal product release is made. However, all features are explained
       within the example programs provided on the distribution disks.


       INSTALLATION


            There are no hard disk requirements for BARCODES-LITE.

            HOWEVER, WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT USE THESE PROGRAMS
       ON THEIR ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION DISK(S).

            THE ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION DISK(S) HAVE BEEN WRITE PROTECTED FOR
       YOUR PROTECTION.  WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT REMOVE OR
       DEACTIVATE THE WRITE PROTECTION DEVICE.  THE ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION
       DISK(S) SHOULD NEVER BE WRITTEN TO, FOR YOUR PROTECTION.

            You should immediately make a backup copy of the BARCODESLITE
       Distribution Disk(s) and store the original(s) in a safe place.
       As systems very, please consult your system manual for instructions on
       coping these programs.

            BARCODES-LITE has no special disk or path requirements, however
       we suggest you copy the programs to a hard disk if available, this
       will also make it easier for you to use the library programs.

            BARCODES-LITE is distributed in object file format.  Because of
       different operating systems, languages, compilers, library managers
       and calling procedures, we have not pre-built any libraries.
       Therefore, you must build any required libraries. Otherwise, you may
       access the object files directly, depending on your particular system
       requirements.
