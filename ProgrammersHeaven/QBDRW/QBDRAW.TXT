Working with QB draw is quite simple. Choose the color you want to use
from the palette in the right bottom of the screen (left-click). 
Then, choose one one of the 3 drawing tools: 
- The point 
- Full box 
- Empty box 
or one of the two others: 
- The eye picker 
- The mask tool.



1.1
To select a tool, left-click on it's image in the
right side of the the zoom window.
All the work takes place in the "zoom window":
--------------------------------------------
With point: just left-click, to draw a point. 
With eye-picker: left-click to get the color from the image.
With empty box: left-click and drag to create a box.
With full box: left-click and drag to create a box.
With mask creator: left-click and drag to create a mask.(select an area for
                   the special effects)

RGB values. Click on 'Yes' to keep the changes. 'No' to cancel.

To save\load palette: click on the 'palette options' button that is above the
palette. Then choose one of the three options in the menu:

   box that will appear.)
2. to load a palette (enter a palette file name and click 'yes' on the massage
   box that will appear.)
3. to edit current color, as explained above.


1.4
Usage of the two buttons in the left of the palette:
 'copy color' - copies the current color to another place in the palette.
                First, choose the color you want to copy. Click on 'copy
                color', and then click on another color on the palette. To
                cancel, click on 'cancel' on the massage box that will appear.

                first color for the gradient, click on 'create gradient' and
                then click on the secend color. To cancel, click on the
                'cancel' button on the massage box that will appear.

'File' menu usage:

           In this version, the program will not alert overwriting file.
           be carefull !

'Image' menu usage:

  Softness   -Makes the image soften. If you've selected mask, the effect will
              be only inside the mask. If not, the effect will be on all the 
              image.
  Invert     -inverts the colors in the image. If you've selected mask, 
              the effect will be only inside the mask. If not, the effect 
              will be on all the image.
  Make mask  -That doesn't work on this version. 
  Change red   -decrease or increase the red color apearence on you image
                If you've selected mask, the effect will be only inside  
                the mask. If not, the effect will be on all the image.
  Change blue  -Same as red, but with blue.             
  Change green -Same as red, but with green.             
  Brightness   -Decrease or increase the brightness on your image. If mask
                selected, it will effect only on the mask.
  Stretch      -This allow you to stretch the image for any size you choose.
                Very useful. Change X and Y in the box, and press "Yes".

1.9
 Do not run the program in Windows95 (tm) in a box ! if you run it in DOS
 shell, make sure you work in full screen mode.


2.0
 To use the images in Qbasic (that's why this program is for) open the
 "QBDRAW.BAS" in qbasic. It should have inside all the info to open files.

2.1
 Your licence to use the program:
 just kidding ! This program is free, and we encourge you to use it. However,
 If you use this program to create images in your game, please give me a

 Also: If you disturb QBdraw in current or other versions, you must
