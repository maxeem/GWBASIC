Starz Gaze - Instructions:

Object:
The object of Starz Gaze is to try and destroy the Alien
Ship.

==========================SHIPS=========================

Alien Ship:
===========
	The Alien ship is the Red one, closest to the 
top of the screen.

As he moves from side to side, each time he gets to the
end of the screen he will move down slightly.

Whenever you hit him with one of your Lasers watch out
for speeding shrapnel.

Your Ship:
==========
	Your Ship is the Blue one in the middle of the 
screen.

You have to wait for your last laser to go off the
screen before you can fire again.

If you go to a far side you will appear on the oposite
side.

=========================Lives==========================

In the Left, bottom hand corner of the screen are two
lives indicators.
The one in Blue = Your Lives Left.
The one in Red  = Alien Lives left.

The Alien ship is much more advanced than yours, this
makes his lives much more higher than yours.

If the Lives indicator reads 0 that does not mean the 
level is finished - it means you are using your last
life now. It also means nearly all systems are down and
you may experience some problems controlling your ship.

If the aliens lives are on 0 then the Alien Ship will
start to plumit. He is sure to die, but if you hit him
whilst he is free-falling you gain extra points.

==========================Points========================

Points are awarded when you have...
	- managed to hit an Alien Ship
	- completed a section
	- completed a level

Points are deducted when
	- you are hit by anything
	- each time the alien ship moves
	- each time the alien ship moves down a level
	
==========================Levels========================
	 
As the levels progress the alien ship starts to move
faster from side to side.
In each level there is 4 sections...

Section 1 - There is only you and the alien ship.
Section 2 - White Stars start to try and take your
	    attention away from the actuall game making
	    it harder to determine where the Aliens
	    Lasers and shrapnel are.
Section 3 - Is the same but with the added distraction
	    of Red stars too.
Section 4 - Also has the other two colours and Green.

=========================Controls=======================	
If you want to move your ship left or right you only
have to press the actuall key once, otherwise the game
will stall.

The default keys are:

Left   = (Left Arrow)
Right  = (Right Arrow)
Fire   = (Space)

You can change these controls if you wish in the
"Ships Computer - Ship" Screen.


==========================General=======================

The indication of lives left for both ships is situated
in the bottom left hand-corner. The blue colour is your
lives and the red is the aliens lives.

Next to those is the Section/Level, your score and the
high score underneath.
If at any time you are above the high score, your score
will start to change colours.

To quit the game press "Q"

To turn the sound on or off you can press F1 on the Ship
Screen.
