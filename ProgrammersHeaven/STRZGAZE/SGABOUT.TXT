In the year 2500 the earth was polluted
beyond repair.
The  humans  terraformed  to  a planet
out  of  the Earth's  Galaxy - a planet
named E2HL (Earth 2, Human Land). This
planet has everything the humans need.

Before the Humans moved to E2HL a race
of  other  life-forms   were  interested
in it also. They felt  the  Humans had
invaded and stole their future planet.

The  Humans  Terraform   and   Defence
organisations   planned  a  conference
with  the  other  life-form  to try and
bring  peace  and an  agreement to the
aposing aliens.
The  conference  went  very  well  and
both parties  had agreed  to  share the
planet  and  name   it  CP1
(Community Planet 1).  Although   many
people  did not really  mind the other
life-form on their planet, there  was a
small majority (10%) of  each race who
apposed to this.

By 2700 this percentage had  risen  to
35%.
That  Human  Year  there  was  a  huge
conference  where  all  interplanetary
leaders were able to meet and  discuss
future ideas.
On the last day there was a killing of
one of the leaders..."

A small boy  sat  on  a
hill watching  the  early Star  slowly
move  over  the  planet,  shining  its
light  down  upon  the  tracks  below.
The   stars   twinkled   brighter  and
brighter,  giving   the  atmosphere  a
feel of danger."

He   watched    the    edge   of   the
horizon,  he   watched  carefully  the
dots  that  were  getting  larger  and
larger... they   were  winding  around
each  other   at  speeds un-recognised
to his eyes. 
They   began   to get closer and their
detail   was   coming clearer
- the sight   he   saw   was  not   of
peace,... it was of war.
Suddenly one  of   the   now   obvious
ships    fired   a   laser    straight
from   the   underneath   of   it,  so
bright   it   hurt   to   look at. The
offending   laser   struck   the  city
below,   gave   out   a sound that 
increased   in   pitch...
 
The city lit up...

The city then became nothing...

The boy TRYED to run.


Intergalactic War - you've heard of it
but  you've never actually experienced
it.
The time has come, it's your turn.
You have been demanded to help save
Human Mankind - have you got the
skill, the accuracy, and the
determination?
Well you will very soon find out.

After Remote Robots were developed we
decided to develop SSC (Satellite Ship
Control). The using of Satellites
to control remote ships from quite a 
far distance. This enables us to go
into battle without the risk of human
life been lost.
We thought we had it all worked out,
I mean what a great idea! Or was it?

We went into battle, and for the
first couple of weeks we were
trashing those alien butts! - But
those alien butts had become clever.
They've worked out our Remote Satellite
Code, and decided have decided
to use it to their
benefit. With our code they can
Visa Versa the ships controls, they
can disrupt Satellite Communications,
and SSC preferences.
When they have destroyed all your
Ships - They will come for YOU...

You cannot run - They will chase,

You cannot hide - They will find.
