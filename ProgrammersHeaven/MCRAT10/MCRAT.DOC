          Have you ever  wanted to make  use of a  mouse in the  Quick
          Basic programs that you write?   What exactly do you have to
          add to your existing programs to trap the mouse movement and
          positions?   Is there an  easy way to add  mouse routines to
          your existing programs?

          Yes!  Introducing  "McRat" version  1.0 for MicroSoft  Quick
          Basic version  4.   Give your  programs that  "professional"
          appearance with a mouse interface.   The "McRat" subroutines
          will make adding a mouse interface to your programs easy.

          The following is a suggested method for installing the McRat
          libraries  and demo program.   Your installation  of the ap-
          plication  my  differ based  on  your hardware  and software
          setup, and the tools you use to maintain your system.

               1.   Select  the  subdirectory  that contains
                    your Quick Basic routines.
               2.   Ensure that the McRat file  names do not
                    conflict with existing files.
               3.   UnZIP the McRat  files into the selected
                    subdirectory.
               4.   Run the  MCRATDEM program  to print  the

               1.   Change to the  subdirectory that contains the
                    MCRATDEM program.
               2.   Enter the command MCRATDEM at the DOS prompt.
               3.   To select items  on the menu, move  the mouse
                    cursor  to the  desired  item and  click  any
                    button,  or  use  the   Tab  /  Shift-Tab  to
                    highlight the item and press enter to select.
               4.   To  return  to   the  menu   press  any   key
                    (including mouse buttons).

                            USING THE MOUSE INTERFACE                            USING THE MOUSE INTERFACE                            _________________________


          With the McRat subroutines you can  add a mouse interface to
          any text screen with a few easy steps.

          1.   When ever you call one  of the McRat subroutines  check
               the value of McRatComRC% after  the call has completed.
               If  the  value  is  zero, the  subroutine  successfully
               executed the request.   If the value is non  zero check
               the "Exit  Errors"  for the  individual subroutines  to
               determine the cause of the error.

          2.   All data items used by the McRat subroutines are simple
               signed integers.

          3.   Include the BASIC  statements in  the MCRATCOM file  in
               the  main  program.   These  statements will  setup the
               \McRat\  common area  with the  arguments McRatComInt%,
               McRatComCsr%,  McRatComPen%,  and  McRatComRC%.    Your
               program should not modify this items at any time.  They
               are status holders for the McRat subroutines.

          4.   The  first  routine  that  any  program  must  call  is
               "McRatInt". This  is the McRat  initialization process-
               ing, and must be  called before any of the  other McRat
               routines are invoked.

          The  McRat   package  includes   both   the  Quick   Library
          (MCRAT.QLB) to be use with Quick Basic, and the Link Library
          (MCRAT.LIB) to be used with the LINK command.  See you Quick
          Basic manuals for information on using libraries.

                    with this value.

                    If the cursor type is  hardware the value of  this
                    item must be set to the starting scan line for the
                    cursor.
          Parm2%    If the cursor  type is software the  character at-
                    tribute value at the cursor position will be XORed
                    with this value.
                    If the cursor  type is hardware the value  of this
                    item must be set  to the ending scan line  for the
                    cursor.

          This subroutine can  be used to  control the type of  cursor
          that will be displayed for  mouse movement.  If a cursor  is
          not defined  the default cursor is inverse of the background
          and foreground attributes.

                    have a value of zero.

          Each time this subroutine is called it will check the status
          of the mouse.  If the  mouse has not been active, processing
          will return to the  main program and the Mk%  parameter will
          be zero.   If the mouse button  has been pushed the location
          of the mouse at the time the button was pushed will be saved
          and the subroutine will  wait for the button to  be release.
          When the button is release the location of the mouse will be
          stored and control will be return to the main program.

          This subroutine will turn the Mouse / Light Pen Emulation On
          and Off.  While Light Pen Emulation is on the standard BASIC
          commands for Light Pen trapping  and processing should work.
          With the  MicroSoft  Mouse and  driver  that I  was  running
          during  testing,  both mouse  buttons  had to  be  pushed to
          register the light pen.

          Note:   The mouse cursor must be turn  off when ever you are
          doing printing that may cause the  screen to scroll.  If you

          scroll with the screen.

          This is release 1.x  of the application.  I know  that there
          will be changes and fixes that will result in release 1.x+1.
          Your input will help determine what changes are necessary to
          improve the application.  If while  using McRat you have any
          suggested enhancements  to the program,  documentation, etc.
          please let me  know.  Every  consideration will be given  to
          the reports on the application.

          Depending  on the  success of  this release,  there will  be
          future release.  Even  as I sit here coding I have a list of
          "advanced" features  (including graphics support)  that will
          be part of the version 2.  Again comments and ideas from you
          will help shape the future of the McRat application.
