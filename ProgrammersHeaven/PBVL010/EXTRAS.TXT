
    DSE's Favorite ShareWare
    ======================================================================

    First of all, let us tell you that we (DSE Software Publishing) are not
    in the ShareWare distributing business, but when we found these files,
    we knew we had to make them available to our valued customers.

    We refuse to sell garbage.  Each of these diskettes contain materials
    and information that we use every single day.  They have saved us time
    and money, and we know that they will do the same for you.

    Read the descriptions carefully.  If you like what you read, just check
    the appropriate spaces on your order form and we send them with your
    PB/VISION(tm) order.  If you need more information, someone from our
    friendly customer support staff will be more than happy to help you.


    DOS Programmer's Technical Reference by Dave Williams
    ======================================================================
    If you are one of the countless people who spent hundreds of dollars
    for your technical reference manuals, you are in for a big surprise.
    From world-renowned author Dave Williams, comes the "DOS Programmer's
    Technical Reference" a complete technical manual for MS-DOS
    programmers.  This disk contains the complete ShareWare release.  The
    commercial release costs only $20.00 and contains MORE than 3 MEG of
    text and utilities.  This has everything.

    Note from DSE: We have spent thousands of dollars for our technical
    reference materials, but Dave's manual is the ONLY one we refer to on a
    daily basis.


    The Shareware Book by Robert Schenot      (A Software Marketing Guide)
    ======================================================================

    Occasionally, I purchase a product I'm so enthusiastic about that I
    want to share it with you.  _The ShareWare Book_ is just such a
    product.  If you have an interest in starting a small software
    company, this is an invaluable resource, providing nuts and bolts
    references and ideas.

    We are providing the disk-based version (360Kb reader program with 
    188 pages of text), but when you register with the author, you will
    get 190 offset printed pages with a laminated cover, and a 1.44Mb 
    "Author's Kit")
