         QUESTION: When using the graphical mouse cursor, the mouse cursor
                   in the QB or QBX editor looks funny.  And when appearing
                   over some characters, there is a single pixel line at
                   the right of the mouse cursor.  Why?

         ANSWER:   1. To display the graphical mouse cursor, the mouse
                   driver is tricked into thinking it is in a graphics
                   mode.  Since the ProWindows(tm) code that keeps the
                   mouse working right is not active when the program is
                   not running, the mouse acts strange.

                   For this reason, we recommend that you do not use the
                   graphics mouse cursor during program development.  When
                   you are ready to create the EXE file, then insert the
                   graphics mouse module.

                   2.  Because of the way VGA cards operate, some
                   characters are 8 pixels wide and some are 9 pixels wide.
                   The mouse driver can't handle both.  The only time you
                   will see this line is when the cursor is over characters
                   in the range of ASCII 176-178.  THIS IS INHERENT TO VGA
                   CARDS ONLY AND DOES NOT AFFECT EGA CARDS.

                   When your program is finished running, you should call
                   the function ResetVideo() to re-map the characters to
                   thier original state.

         QUESTION: Why does my program quit and print a "REGISTRATION
                   ENCOURAGEMENT" error message?

         ANSWER:   Then the version you have is our ShareWare version.  The
                   ShareWare version works just like the registered version
                   with the exception that you must call the Notice()
                   routine within 60 seconds of calling the InitPro()
                   routine.

                   The Notice() routine displays a message reminding you of
                   your obligation to register and pay for your copy if you
                   decide to use it on a regular basis.

         NOTE:     When you register, we will send you a disk that does not
                   require the use of the Notice() routine.  Because of
                   this, the library is smaller and generates smaller EXE
                   files.

         QUESTION: When I try to run my program in the BASIC environment, I
                   get a "SUBPROGRAM NOT DEFINED" message.  Why?

         ANSWER:   In order to use an external (non BASIC) function, you
                   must load them into BASIC.  This is done from the
                   command line by entering (for our demos) :

                        QB /AH /L lite.qlb          (for QuickBASIC)
                        QBX /AH /EA /L lite.qlb     (for BASIC PDS 7)

                   To be sure that you do not pass invalid parameters to a
                   function, you must include the appropriate INCLUDE (.BI)
                   file(s) in your BASIC source code.  To use ProWindows
                   LITE functions, you would use:

                        REM $INCLUDE : 'lite.bi'

                   If it still does not work, go to the "Set Paths" under
                   the "Options" menu in the QB.EXE (or QBX.EXE) and make
                   sure that the "Include Path" points to the drive and
                   directory where the ProWindows (.BI) files are.

         QUESTION: My programs are getting larger and i'm quickly running
                   out of memory.  What do I do?

         ANSWER:   ProWindows(tm) by default uses normal DOS memory to
                   allocate it's video buffer.  This can easily consume up
                   to 64K of memory.

                   FEAR NOT!  "WMM.EXE" may be the solution.  The external
                   "Window Memory Manager" attempts to convert other memory
                   resources into video buffer memory.  WMM.EXE can convert
                   expanded (EMS) or extended (XMS).  When used with
                   "LOADHIGH" (DOS 5), "LOADHI" (QEMM), or similar utility,
                   "upper memory" can also be converted.  This utility is
                   included FREE with ProWindows(tm).

         QUESTION: Why does the mouse cursor disappear when I print text to
                   a window or the screen?

         ANSWER:   Unlike BASIC's built-in PRINT statements (which use BIOS
                   calls, ProWindows print statements (which write directly
                   to video RAM) are not aware of the mouse.  When printing
                   text to a window, you should disable the mouse cursor,
                   print the text, and then re-enable it.  Try:

                        MouseCursorOff

                        ' text printing function

                        MouseCursorOn

         QUESTION: Is it true that you met Elvis during the time you were
                   being held captive by group of aliens from the planet
                   Kaplutis?

         ANSWER:   No, he was just an impersonator.

         QUESTION: What do I do when LINK.EXE tells me I have "TOO MANY
                   SEGMENTS"?

         ANSWER:   Cry.  Just kidding!  LINK defaults to 128 segments.  The
                   following example shows you how to increase the segments
                   to 256 (but you can use higher or lower numbers):

                        LINK /SE:256

         QUESTION: What can I do to make my EXE files smaller?

         ANSWER:   The size of an EXE file is not necessarily related to
                   how much memory the program will use.  A good portion of
                   the EXE file contains the "header" and "relocation
                   table".  The parts are NOT part of the program  and are
                   NOT loaded.  They are just there to tell DOS how to load
                   the program.

                   When compiling from DOS, be sure to specify the '/EX'
                   command when using LINK.EXE.  This reduces the file size
                   by about 30%.

                   When you register your copy of ProWindows(tm), we will
                   include a free copy of two programs that will further
                   reduce the size of an EXE file by about 50% (average).

                   We are constantly making our libraries smaller and
                   smaller.  As a registered user, you are entitled to FREE
                   updates of the latest libraries (does not include major
                   upgrades).  In the last 2 months, we have made changes
                   that have netted a 35% reduction in the size of
                   ProWindows(tm) programs.  We are not stopping there.

         QUESTION: What is "Video Recycling"?

         ANSWER:   To maintain its high speed performance when manipulating
                   windows, the Window Manager requires about 8K of memory
                   as a "scratch pad".  In standard mode, this memory is
                   allocated out of the VirMem%() array and conventional
                   memory.

                   With all the memory demands placed on the system by the
                   BASIC IDE and your programs, you want to limit the size
                   of your arrays by as much as possible.  This is the
                   purpose of the VideoRecycle() routine.  It forces the
                   Window Manager to use the unused memory of your
                   CGA/EGA/VGA cards and frees up about 24K of memory.

                   Now you can reduce the size of the VirMem%() array and
                   still maintain a large number of windows.

                   Please note that you should only use this routine during
                   program development.  When creating a stand-alone EXE
                   file, you should remove the command and increase the
                   size of the VirMem%() array (typically to 32000).

         QUESTION: I just can't seem to get anything to work.  What am I
                   doing wrong?

         ANSWER:   For every complex problem, there is probably an easy
                   solution.  If you get stuck, follow the next four steps:

                        1).  Do not get mad or upset.
                        2).  Take a couple of deep long breaths and relax.
                        3).  Carefully read the file called "SUPPORT.DOC".
                        4).  Contact DSE Technical Support in the manner
                             easiest for you.  Remember: There is no such
                             thing as a "dumb question".

         QUESTION: Two cars are on a collision course on the Interstate.
                   Cars "A" and "B" are maintaining a constant of speed of
                   65 mph and 45 mph, respectively.

                   When the two cars are exactly 110 miles apart, a lonely
                   bored fly (on a caffeine binge) starts flying from car
                   "A" to car "B" at a steady speed of 92 mph.  When the
                   fly reaches car "B" he zips around and heads back
                   towards car "A".  He keeps going from car to car until
                   both cars collide.

                   How many miles did the fly travel before getting
                   squashed between the two colliding cars?
