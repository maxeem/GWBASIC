
FOR THE NEW BASIC PROGRAMMER

     To make use of the ProWindows(tm) functions, you must first
     create the proper libraries so that QB.EXE (or QBX.EXE) and
     the BC.EXE command line compiler can access the functions.

     First you are going to need a standard library.  A standard
     library is something like an archive file (this program is
     distributed as an archive) and it contains all the code and
     data needed to make each function work.  Standard libraries
     end with a ".LIB" file extension and are for the use of
     LINK.EXE . These files are used only when creating stand-
     alone programs (that do not require the QuickBASIC
     environment), and when creating a "Quick Library".

     A Quick Library has a ".QLB" file extension and is used only
     by BASIC environment.  You can think of a Quick Library has a
     cross between a standard library (LIB) and a TSR type
     program.  QLB files are loaded into memory at the same time
     BASIC is loaded and they are what gives you the instant
     access to the ProWindows(tm) functions.

     To create both types of libraries, we have included three (3)
     batch (BAT) files that do it all for you.

     MOUSE.BAT creates a library that supports mouse control of
     the windows.  NOMOUSE.BAT does everything the above does
     except it does not support mouse control.  SMALL.BAT make a
     library that has window functions only (no mouse or event
     support).

     To load the QLB file into BASIC, enter:

          QB /AH /L LITE              (for QuickBASIC)
          QBX /AH /EA /L LITE         (for BASIC PDS 7)

     One last thing.  If you get a LINK error when you run any of
     the batch files, make sure that you are using the latest
     and correct version of the LINK.EXE program.  We have
     received plenty of calls from people who were trying to use
     the QuickC linker and it plain doesn't work.

     That's it!  If you need help, the instruction manual just
     about covers everything.  If you still need a little nudge in
     the right direction, contact our Product Support Service (See
     SUPPORT.DOC).  Our staff is so darned friendly that we make
     June Cleaver look like Freddy Krueger.
