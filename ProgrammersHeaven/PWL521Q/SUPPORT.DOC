                     -----------------------

     First and best, GEnie charges a flat rate of $4.95 per month
     for 300/1200/2400 baud service.  This is for UNLIMITED usage
     of Electronic mail, news, on-line encyclopedia, and about 100
     other services.  Some services (such as download libraries)
     charge $6.00 per hour.  At 2400 baud, that is quite a deal.

     GEnie has a new "Try-it-before-you-buy-it" type of policy
     says that you can try it for a month, and if you don't like
     it, they will refund your $4.95.

     GEnie also has more local access nodes that ANY other on-line
     service so there is probably a node in your town.
