-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER -- This takes place over all warranties, written or oral.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        I have no control over what you do with Bansi and so you can't blame
anything on me.  I hold no responsibilty for what it does or what you make it
do to anything -- your computer, your health (your health???), anything --  I
have to have this in here and I am not responsible.

Your License For Bansi
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        You now have a copy of Bansi v1.11.  You are licensed to use this
library in any software that you write.  If this library is registered, you
CANNOT distribute it.  You must only distribute the freeware version of the 
library, which can be found as BANSI111.<ZIP/ARJ/ETC...).  You are not allowed
to do any of (but not limited to) the following: disassemble, decompile, or in
any other way reverse engineer or change/add to any of the files in this
package or the actual package itself.  I hold the copyright to this library
and reserve all rights to change anything in the file(s) and/ or document(s)
and/ or package(s) and also reserve the right to give/revoke/change licenses. 
The file BANSI111.ZIP should contain the following files:

More about your License for Bansi... {UNREGISTERED ONLY}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        The Bansi library is free for personal use for the first 90 days.  If
you want to use the Bansi library in your own programs, that's fine with me -
until your license expires.  If, after the 90th day, you use this library and
have not sent off your registration, you are breaking the law!  It is illegal
to use this program after the 90th day without registration.  This is only a
"Test Drive" of the program - a "Try Before You Buy" approach that lets you
use the program for a period of time before you either decide to get rid of
it or buy it (90 days in this case)...  I am grateful for all registrations. 
$8 for Registration is not by any means expensive, and barely covers my costs. 
This program is not meant to be expensive, but to be widely used and feasable
for any programmer to use (and buy)...  I thank you for your support of this
and my other products.

What Bansi DOES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Bansi is a library consisting of many ANSI functions.  It will return
the ANSI sequences for the corresponding functions after parameters are
passed.  All commands are compatible with ANSI.SYS and most ANSI compatible
(if not all) terminal programs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETTING UP Bansi
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        To set up Bansi, just include the .LIB file either in the working
directory of the program to use them in or in the QuickBasic Library
directory.  Include the .BI file in the QuickBasic Include directory or the
working directory of the program to use it in.
        To create a Quick Library for QB/VB-DOS, just run the CREATE
utility furnished with Bansi.
