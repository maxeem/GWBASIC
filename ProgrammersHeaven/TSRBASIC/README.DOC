2.0   Running TsrBasic

Please read this entire file before using TsrBasic.

Make sure TSRBASIC.EXE and GRAPH.DLL are in your current
directory or in a directory included in your DOS PATH.

If you have a Hercules compatible graphics adapter and 
would like to use TsrBasic graphics then run MSHERC.COM
before you start TsrBasic.

To start TsrBasic, just type TSRBASIC at the DOS prompt.
See the documentation for more information on command line
options.

To suspend from TsrBasic back to DOS, enter the SUSPEND
statement at the TsrBasic prompt. This makes TsrBasic
terminate and stay resident. To return to TsrBasic from
DOS or any other application, type control-shift-b.

To unload TsrBasic from memory, enter the QUIT command.


3.0   Demo Programs

To run a demo program, type the following, starting at
the DOS prompt:

  tsrbasic
  load calc
  run

or

  tsrbasic
  load clock
  run

Look at the source to the demo programs for more information
on how they operate and the commands they can accept. Note that 
both CALC.BAS and NOTEPAD.BAS are popup programs that can be put
into the background by pressing the ESCAPE key and recalled
by pressing control-shift-b.

To terminate a TsrBasic program type control-c. To terminate
the interpreter, type QUIT.
