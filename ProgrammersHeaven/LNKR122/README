                                UPDATE HISTORY
                                --------------
     
     03-17-90 - Initial release.
     
     04-30-90 - Added support for multiple data files and batch operation.
                Compressed the help screens to decrease modem transfer
                time. Added color configuration and text editor support.
     
     05-13-90 - Added a carriage return to the temporary response file to
                accommodate LINK.EXE from BC7 PDS.
     
     11-27-90 - Increased the size of the data fields by 11 characters.
                Fixed problem when paths were included in stub and library
                file names. Updated help. Added testing for COMSPEC. Added
                auto-conversion routines for different size data files.

     06-16-91 - Added another data line for stub files. Added the "/CO"
                command line switch for compiling only. Now displays the
                name of module while compiling. Fixed parsing when extra
                spaces were between stub and library names. 

     07-14-91 - COMSPEC no longer required for execution of child processes.
                Fixed bug when compiling errors occurred on last module.
                Reduced time needed for error detection.

     09-28-91 - Removed test for COMSPEC (oops!). Brush up of documentation.
                Fixed bug on /CO switch that would allow program operation
                without drawing the screen.
     
     11-23-91 - Fixed bug with /C switch caused by fixing bug to /CO switch.
                Added user abort detection to compiling algorithm.

     11-28-92   Fix bug involving dual monitor use.
