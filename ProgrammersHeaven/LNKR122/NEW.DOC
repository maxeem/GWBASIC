                         Compiler/Linker Assistant 1.22
                          (C) 1990,1991 by Robin Duffy
    
         This text covers the changes to the program with this maintenance
    release. Other information contained in L.DOC is still valid.
    
         To install LINKER on your system for the first time follow the
    instructions for installation as outlined in L.DOC. Users of LINKER
    earlier than version 1.2 should erase the old executable and help
    files from disk, and replace them with these newer versions. If you
    are using LINKER 1.2 you may just copy the new L.EXE on top of the old
    one. The new program will automatically convert old data files from
    any of the earlier version to the new format.
    
         There is a new command line switch for LINKER. The updated
    command line looks like this:
    
                        L {/Q} {/R | /C | /CO filename}
    
         /Q, /R and /C all function as documented in L.DOC. The new
    command line switch "/CO" tells LINKER to compile your source code
    only and skip the linking process.
    
         When given with a data file name, the program will compile
    modules in batch mode like the /C switch. If errors occur while
    compiling, the DOS ERRORLEVEL is set to a value of 50 and the program
    exits.  After all modules are compiled LINKER will skip the link call
    and exit to DOS. If the switch is given without a data file name, the
    program will start in full screen mode. Pressing the TAB key will
    compile modules, then Linker will exit to the DOS prompt. When given
    with the /r datafile parameter, Linker will read the data file and
    start in full screen mode. Pressing TAB will compile the modules only
    and exit to DOS.
    
         There are two special key presses you may use while editing text
    on the data lines. ALT-C will clear the entire line of text and home
    the cursor on that line. ALT-R will restore the previous contents of
    the line provided you have not left the field. Once you leave a field
    the previous contents are lost. These key presses have always been
    present, but due to an oversight they had been omitted from the
    documentation.
    
         I now have a 24 hour support BBS. The BBS number is (606) 561-5766.
    I support 300 - 14,400 baud, v.32/v.42bis and MNP 2 - 5. Here you may
    ask a question, tell me what you think, or get the latest version of all
    my products.
