----------                                              Aug 20, 1985

Purpose:  Convert an interpreted BASIC file to an ASCII format
          file.

Syntax:   RB  filename.bas  newfile.bas

Remarks:  The two file names are required. The first specifies
          the name of an interpreted BASIC program, the second
          is the name to be given to the new ASCII file.

          Floating point numbers are not rounded but no precision
          is lost.

          RB accomplishes the same task as using the BASIC interpreter
          to save a BASIC file in ASCII form, for example:

                basic
                load"myprog
                save"myprog.asc",a
                system

                -or-

                rb myprog.bas myprog.asc

          The reasons for using RB are:

                - the interpreter is not needed (not everyone gets
                  a BASIC interpreter with their system)
                - RB is much faster
                - allows using BATch files for use with compilers
