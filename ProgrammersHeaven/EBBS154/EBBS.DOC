INTRODUCTION

This is quick intro to EBBS-PC for those wishing to jump right in.
EBBS-PC is intuitive and is very easy to setup, use, maintain and
run.

SUGGESTED SETUP

You should have at least a 512k machine with a hard drive on it and
at least a 1200 baud modem set up correctly. Anything bigger and
better will only enhance your EBBS system.

EBBS works fine on monochrome or color, but color is suggested to
get the nice ANSI screen's. EGA/VGAers can use the extended line
setting to get 43+ lines on screen at once as well.

SETUP will come in a second. First some miscellaneous info:

Quick List of FEATURES:

EBBS-PC has a nice array of features, and this update (v1.5x)
really enhanced the list. Here's a few interesting feature's:

 1) User selectable ANSI/Non ANSI modes.
 2) Multi downloading via ymodem batch or zmodem.
 3) Some DOOR modules.
 4) 26 message bases.
 5) 26 file transfer sections.
 6) 300 - 115 kbaud support. (IE: High Speed modem support.)
 7) COM0: (local!) & COM1: - COM4: support.
 8) Standard X, Y & Zmodem file transfers using DSZ driver.
 9) Improved, easier configuration. (Similiar to CONFIG.SYS!)
10) 43/50 (etc) line mode support.
11) Code has been optimized, resulting in faster execution.
12) Self maintains 95% of itself. No message base packing, etc.
13) Powerful, fast and easy to use line editor.
14) Full complement of useful Sysop functions & event modules.
15) Instant userfile searches using btree search algorythm.
16) Powerful, fast and easy EMAIL features.
17) Error trapping to avoid 99% of all crash related problems.
18) Infinite user levels.
19) FILE_DIZ.ID in ZIP/ARJ's displayed before DL.
20) Powerful PSUDEO Shell for local/remote Sysop.
21) Powerful userfile & xferfile editor.
22) Online full screen ANSI editor.

Plus MUCH more...

These is a simple list of some of EBBS' general and enhanced
features.  Basically, EBBS-PC is very intuitive, has online help
menu's at every prompt, operates at a high degree of efficiency,
is very easy to setup, use and maintain and offers features of
systems costing hundreds of dollars.

TIP'S & NOTES:

 1) EBBS is now compiled and converted to PowerBASIC v3.0.
 2) EBBS L will boot EBBS in local ONLY mode. (No modem init)
 3) DOS Psudeo Shell only works for local sysop(s) or User #1.
 4) Userfile editor only work's for U#1 or local sysop(s).
 5) Remote Sysop can read U#1 email from MAIN MENU.
 6) Remote Sysop can read FEEDBACK from the Sysop Menu.
 7) A rash of new support EVENT modules now exist. Use them
    to keep the userfile current, the xferfile clean, etc.
 8) I STILL suggest an external modem. Internal's working 24 hours
    per day STILL seem to have heat (lockup) prob's.
 9) When encoutnering bugs, keep a detailed list and report
    them. To fix 'em, I need to duplicate the problem.
10) Keep a list of questions handy. Write them down AS they arise.
    Then contact me on EBBS HQ (818-891-9350) and drop me feedback. I
    answer my mail twice daily, so a semi immediate answer is always
    handy.
11) Use ? to show a list of msg/xfer area's when editing the
    level of users. (Tip: ESCape will home/delete line.)

WHY POWERBASIC v3.0?

This is THEE BASIC these day's! When v3.0 came out, it offered a
rash of new feature's that makes it VERY attractive to ALL BASIC
programmers. It uses XMS/EMS/VMS to allow you to handle VERY
LARGE BASIC source files! It offer's alot of new feature's (the
COM1-COM4 and 115k baud support ALWAYS attracted me), and it is
still STRONGLY supported. If you want to modify EBBS-PC, this is
a MUST have product!

EBBS-PC source is currently about 103k and it compiles to machine
language on my 386/20SX in about 15 seconds. Not too bad at all!
It reports I STILL have 170k or memory (approx) to add more mods,
so future updates are a possibility.

EBBS-PC no longer requires an external RUN TIME LIBRARY.

EXTERNALLY REQUIRED FILES/PROGRAMS

DSZ - This program is used exclusively in EBBS-PC for it's file
transfers.  It can be found on most any PC based Bulletin Board System
as well as on my EBBS HQ system.

PKUNZIP - This file decompresses the EBBSxxxx.ZIP file.

THEDRAW - I used this to come up with all the EBBS ANSI menu's.

DR - This is an ANSI DIR command by Chris Smeets. Very nice.

SANS - This is a font I created with FONTEDIT. Change EVGAFont = SANS
       in your EBBSCFG.DAT file to use it and 43/50 line mode.

       NOTE: For NO FONT (IE: Mono or CGA) simply enter NONE for the
             FONT name in the EBBSCFG.DAT file.


QUICK START

If you are fairly good at intuitive logical programs, you can
probably get EBBS up & running quickly.

Here's some basic's to get you online fast:

LET'S GET ONLINE

Make sure COMMAND.COM, DSZ.EXE (or GSZ.EXE), DR.EXE, etc.as well as
any other EBBS specific programs are in your path.

1) UNZIP the EBBS*.ZIP file into it's own directory, right below the
root directory. I suggest (and use) "C:\EBBS".

For example:

C:\>MD EBBS

C:\>CD EBBS

C:\EBBS>PKUNZIP C:\TEMP\EBBS*

2) Load and edit the EBBSCFG.DAT file.  This is your config file.
Make sure to set up EBBS paths correctly, rename the system, setup
your prefferred system defaults, etc.  Don't forget to resave the
EBBSCFG.DAT file after you edit it.

3) Make SURE you use the SUB DIRECTORY creator (MAKEDIRS.EXE) to
make all your EBBS sub-directories. It will check your EBBSCFG.DAT
file, so make sure you edited that before running MAKEDIRS.EXE.

4) Write any bulletins, text files, etc.  Don't worry, EBBS will
give you a simple error message if a bulletin or text file is not
found, and will tell the name and path it was looking for!  For
example, after a user logs on EBBS will display the OPENING BULLETIN
file. (Called OB on disk.) If this file is not found, EBBS will
indicate so by printing "C:\EBBS\OB" file not found." All you need
to do now, is create the OB file and make sure it is in your EBBS
sub directory and it will display properly next time.

5) Add yourself in as the first user. This is an important step.  Do
not confuse yourself as the first user, with yourself as the System
Operator.  EBBS treats these both differently. A system Operator
does just that. Operates and maintains the system.  EBBS will NOT
keep high message counters, last logon date, etc. info the System
Operator. It WILL keep this (and other) info on you as user number
one however.

6) LIST all the files in the file transfer sections. This will
create the XFERFILE.DAT random files needs to administrate the
file transfer section.

7) Post the first message in each message base.  This will initiate
each message base, create the message base index file, etc.

8) That's it - go online!  You can fine tune along the way.

VITAL INFORMATION

1) When editing a userfile, entering a "?" for the level(s)
   will display the users current access.

2) In the modem RESET and CONFIG strings, a tilde ("~") equals
   a one second delay and the vertical bar ("|") equals RETURN.

3) F10 ReRUN's EBBS-PC when online. Alt-F10 exit's to DOS.

4) Text Files: Add their names into the TM file, then rename the actual
   TEXT file to include the extension of .TXT and place it in the TEXT
   sub directory.

5) Patterns: When searching for user names, you can enter partial's
   as the search pattern.  Example: "Ed Par" will find "Ed Parry".
   This works for sending email, logging on, user editing, etc.

If you have specific questions, drop me feedback on my system.  I answer
all my mail regularly about 6pm on weekday's, and several times
throughout the day on weekends.
