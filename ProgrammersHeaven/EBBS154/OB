Hi Guys!
 
1) Thought I'd update this - I fixed the CRSR controls a week or so
ago on our Screen Editor and the thing is working great now!
 
2) QuickCHESS work has been slow lately, but I have been able to add
in some goodies like INVERT BOARD, MOVE LIST, etc. Figure I'll just
keep plugging away at it and it'll be done before I know it!
 
3) Computer tinkering mood lately - mostly just playing with ASM and C
again for diversion.
 
4) Hope everyone has a nice Easter weekend!
 
5) Happy Birthday's to Billy and Joshua Parry - Billy's was 3/26 and
Joshua's is today - 4/1.  Boy am I getting old...  8-)
