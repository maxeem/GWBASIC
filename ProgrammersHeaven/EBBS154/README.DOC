EBBS-PC v1.54 Notes - Ed Parry - 818-891-9350 - 04-02-1994

WHAT'S NEW:

1) I have decided to release the WHOLE EBBS-PC package, including
source. Think of EBBS-PC as Freeware now.

2) EBBS-PC is written in PowerBASIC v3.0C, so if you want to
modify it, you'll need to buy a copy of PB30C if you do not
already have it.

To contact the PowerBASIC Company directly:

Voice: 1-510-516-7700 - Voice
FAX:   1-510-634-0439 - FAX
BBS:   1-813-625-1172 - BBS

3) I have finally added a full screen ANSI editor. It took a
while to debug and perfect, but it is working great now! It is
built right into EBBS-PC, so it is very fast.

4) I have squashed a few bugs here n there, optimized a few
routines, reformatted the code a bit, etc.

5) I regret to mention that I am not really into EBBS programming
any longer. It has been a long and often difficult project that
just never became profitable.  I have gone into other projects,
so updates will be sporatic at best. I still enjoy running EBBS
HQ though, so feel free to drop by there.

6) Donators giving $20.00 or more will receive unlimited download
priviledges on my EBBS HQ system for life.

Enjoy, Ep
