
EBBS-PC v1.5x offers a full support EBBS system at 818-891-9350.

I normally answer all feedback several times a day. It offers an
EBBS Q&A message base, and a specific EBBS file transfer section.

EBBS HQ Supports all baud rates up to 14.4k baud at @ 8N1. (8 bit
wordsize, no parity, 1 stop bit.) Make sure you turn off your
terminal's local echo. ANSI color is supported as well.

EBBS HQ is in Southern California. Cheapest phone rates for ANYONE
is weeknights after 10pm thru 8am next morning, all day Saturday and
Sundays until 5pm, and again after 10pm.

I suggest AT&T's reach out America plan - during these hours,
they only charge .10-.12 per minute. ($6-$8 per hour - cheap as
alot of network services for ANY baud rate!)
