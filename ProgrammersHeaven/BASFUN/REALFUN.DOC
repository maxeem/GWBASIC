To use the library of real functions, make sure the library is in the same
directory as QuickBASIC.  Then, invoke QuickBASIC with the following command
line (or something similar):

     c:\qb45\qb/l realfun

where is this case, the program is in the c:\qb45 directory.  Once the library
is loaded, you will need to explicitly declare each function that you wish to
use.  For example, to use the 'amod' function, put this line at the top of
your program:

     DECLARE FUNCTION amod! (x!, b!)

and a similar one for any other functions you want to use from this library.
The list of functions, their precision, and description, follows.

Note:  most of the trigonometric functions (regular and hyperbolic sine,
cosine, and tangent) are not one-to-one, that is, more than one value of x
will lead to the same functional value.  This makes it difficult to determine
exactly which value of x to return with the inverse trig functions.  This has
only been accounted for with the inverse tangent function (atan, atand, datan,
datand); you are left to your own devices for the rest.
