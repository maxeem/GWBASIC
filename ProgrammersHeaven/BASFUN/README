This package contains QuickBASIC (v 4.5) library files (.qlb and .lib) that
extend QB's intrinsic functions for real and complex numbers.  The following
files should be in this archive:

     README         (this file)
     REALFUNC.BAS   (QB source code for real function library)
     REALFUN.QLB
     REALFUN.LIB    (library files for real functions)
     REALFUN.DOC    (documentation on real functions and library)
     COMPFUNC.BAS   (QB source code for complex function library)
     COMPFUN.QLB
     COMPFUN.LIB    (library files for complex functions)
     COMPFUN.DOC    (documentation on complex functions and library)

The real library essentially extends QB to include standard FORTRAN functions.
It also includes a modulo function that returns floating point values, and
minimum and maximum functions.  These are all QB subprogram functions, ie, you
need to include a 'DECLARE FUNCTION' statement in your program to use them.  

The complex library allows you to handle complex numbers by either storing the
real and imaginary parts, or the magnitude and phase.  Since a subprogram
using complex numbers will in general need to return both parts of the answer,
the functions were written as subprograms, ie, you need to include a 'DECLARE
SUB' statement in your program.  The complex library is a superset of the real
library, and includes cartesian-polar and polar-cartesian routines, division
and multiplication, logs and exponentials, and the circular and hyperbolic
trig functions.

Both libraries have all routines in single and double precision.  The source
code for all functions and subprograms is included.

I release this into the public domain, and do so without warranty of any kind.
Void where prohibited by law.  Not for internal consumption.  Your mileage
may vary.
