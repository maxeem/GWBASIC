<pre>Abstract:  This paper discusses the seemingly instantaneous 
boundary layer, which is an interesting property of mass 
(resonance?) that is difficult to reconcile with the general 
field property's 1/g<sup>2</sup> strength with respect to 
distance that are attributed to all particles.   

The physics of boundary repulsion and specifically quantum 
boundary repulsion a bit on the perplexing side if we rely 
on "normal" field properties...

So once again, Joseph_Sixpack visits his kitchen table to 
investigate 'particle physics' while remembering what Doctor 
Ruebsamen, his most perfect chemistry teacher, told him many 
decades ago:  "The word nuclear physics is the wrong word 
that got started with a typographical error in some of the 
very early pages of scientific inquiry.  They transposed the 
'n' and the 'u'.  It should read, 'unclear physics'.

For starters, let's get a toothpick or a straw or a spoon, 
cup, saucer, or any other piece of 'mass' from the cupboards 
or drawers of the kitchen, and with both hands try and push 
whatever was retrieved from the cupboards and is now in your 
hand, completely through the top of the table.  Hey! this is 
a fun exercise, later it gets more painful.

Probably you should start with a toothpick as that works 
best.  Or if you aren't home, just try and push your finger 
through the top of the campus center table where you are 
sipping coffee.  a lot of time i just use a handy physics 
book so there is no loss if you partially succeed and it 
won't come back out.

My best guess is, like my effort, the experiment failed.  
The question now becomes:  Why?

Well, at first consideration, we can be grateful that the 
experiment failed, because if it didn't, your dinner dishes 
would fall right through the table too when you sat down to 
dinner, to say nothing about when you sat in your chair for 
dinner.  Automobile accidents however, would be a bit more 
tolerable.

Now, the field properties of gravity and magnetism are such 
that their strength decreases over distance according to a 
somewhat intuitive mathematical formula.

Or said otherwise, the field strength increases gradually 
the closer you are to the mass that is generating the field.  

Again, both increases and decreases in field strength, 
depending upon which direction you are going, to or from the 
mass, however, occur somewhat gradually and not all at once.

But...  There appear to be some situations otherwise...

Some generated perplexing 'fields' appear to be very abrupt 
and are not related to the reciprocal of the square of the 
distance.  Sigh... probably, they aren't fields at all to 
begin with...

Phase change?  change in state?  threshold?

Graphed out, some fields go up logarithmically (is that the 
right term?) and others offer an almost instant threshold of 
full repulsive (field?) strength.

What we have discovered, wrong word... it should be, 
correctly guessed, or is it incorrectly guessed, is that if 
all particles are accused of generating fields, the standard 
field properties are different for some of the particles 
that are offering resistance by using some source of 
repulsive force to keep from being pushed together and which 
doesn't weaken over distance d but has instead a VERY SHARP 
effect boundary.

Now as far as field conditions are concerned, this doesn't 
make any sense at all because fields don't act like that.  
Can we say the same thing about attracting fields?
what?  where?  how?

Saying again:  The boundary of the 'field' is very, very, 
sharp.  Sort of an instant on, instant off, effect.  This 
can't be a field condition.  It must be something else.

Slam your hand onto the table to get an idea of what is 
being talked about.  Notice how quick your hand stopped when 
it hit the table?  Now do it again 300 times as hard as you 
can.  Notice the bloody stump at the end of your arm where 
your hand used to be?  Some other lesser strength chemical 
bonding events have broken down and distributed your hand's 
remains over the top of the table...  Some chemical bonds 
are strong and some are weak.  but the yuk is still on TOP 
of the table.

hmmm...

What exactly is going on here?...  Consider two resonant 
energy packets (mass) with some apparent sort of hard layer.  
Sort of an in effect,  chelate covering the resonance, stuck 
to the surface of the mass.

Now from a particle physics point of view, just what is 
going on here anyhow, huh?   think about it.... weird...

Can you dream up a physical reality that can cause this to 
happen?  Well, one is out there somewhere, because this 
appears to be and is, a fundamental widespread fact of 
reality.

Things bonk into one another and for the very most of the 
part, don't pass thru one another.  again.   weird.  
especially if we wish to build reality upon what we 
understand about the math properties of fields.

But reality shouldn't be weird - it is mostly very simple.

So what is the problem with our minds that we can't answer 
some fundamental questions like:

What is mass?

What is causing this sharp particle boundary layer with one 
ostensible field and not the other gravity and magnetism 
fields?

This 'repulsive' 'field' is...  is what?

sigh...

Well, more later...  bug joseph_sixpack has hit the 
windshield again and i hear the sound of rice crispies...  

<hr>
                           Later

Well, for a thinking model of our problem let us use a 
single electronless hydrogen atom.

Ummm, let's call it a proton and let us place it somewhere 
in outer space all by itself without any electrons zooming 
about.

i know, i know, electrons are all over the place and such a 
placement is probably impossible.  So let's pretend anyhow 
that our model doesn't have any electrons in orbit and is 
just sitting there subject to no external gravitational 
forces whatsoever, and is perfect round and alone...

Think of it as a very tiny marble in space or a very small ball 
bearing or a really old chicken gizzard.

Anyhow, it is there.

Now what is creating the 'hard shell' that has such a strong 
repulsive effect upon anything that wants to bonk into it?

You know, a round egg would probably be a better model.  

Anyhow, what we have here is something that won't divide too 
easily.  why not?

What is possibly going on within that proton?

Quarks!  Leptons!  Three up and three down you say...

Okay let's take a quark and do the same thing with it.

Now we have a little quark in space.  Now what is creating 
the hard shell?  Anyhow you get the idea.

The question really is:  Just what is happening within this 
'energy bucket' to create 'mass' that can't be 'passed 
through' by generating some sort of instantaneous repulsive 
'field'.

sigh...  jeez... how many centuries is this going to take?

Joseph_sixpack signing off for now...

<hr>

                        Quantum Mass

What do we know about our little 'mass' event in space?

Boy, you talk about a bug hitting the windshield...

Well, wait a minute... The contained energy of the little 
sphere is supposed to equal to E = +/- M*C<sup>2</sup> i am 
told.  So we know how much energy is contained therein.

Now... just what is energy?...

sigh...

This is going nowhere...

Now what has this got to do with the 'repulsive force' 
within the quantum unit?  or for want of a better word, what 
has this got to do with the 'hard shell effect'?

What is doing the barrier stuff?

Or why didn't/can't our finger or any other selected object 
go thru the table?

back in a while?  maybe...

<hr>

                           Later

Okay, lets stop beating our heads against the wall on "shell 
repulsiveness".

Lets' go back to this idea:  Does the photon have a roll in 
creating warped spacetime?  hmmmm...

Is the photon layer around the electron the source of the 
weak gravitational force?

More twilight zone stuff...

If a photon or a photon cloud hangs around the electron...
that would imply?...

hmmm...   ah shit!...

This is going to take awhile...

Okay, i am going to have to throw in the towel for now and 
go to bed to sleep on it...  in way over my head...

Hey!, these are questions for the guys at CERN and all those 
other places where they actually get paid for thinking and 
not a joseph_sixpack.

<hr>

                         The Photon

Well, now we are going to enter the twilight zone...
The zone of the mystical graviton within the quantum whazit.

Well, it has been postulated that the electron with its 
magnetic charge is surrounded by a 'cloud' of photons!
What an interesting concept...
see:  John S. Rigden (HYDROGEN - p167) HarvUnivPress 2002.

<b>Now nothing is going to surround or cluster around 
anything unless it is attracted to the object and has some 
sort of attracting polar field, either gravity or magnetism 
or some other as yet unknown attractive force.</b>

What we have here is some sort of a super microscopic 
galactic cluster...

If photon density is that great surrounding or in an 
electron mass then we can understand, well, maybe not 
understand, but at least have a handle on a possible theory 
on why a nova event issues forth such instantaneous 
brightness.

It is shaking loose its own photons.  A real cosmic light 
show.  A LOT of the photons are cut loose and zing out due 
to some repulsive or collapsing blastomatic event.  a photon 
explosion.  lightshow!

Now, if photons surround an electron can we suggest, just as 
a hypothesis, that perhaps an opposite of a photon (anti- 
photon?) surrounds the single proton in much greater 
numbers? or equal numbers?  your guess...  and that by 
mediating the repulsive or attractive charge use their back 
ends to create a uniform repulsive bonkable shell with very 
abrupt unfieldlike properties.  i am not too fond of the 
anti-photon idea.

i like this idea better:  If the photons stick to an 
electron they do so because they are somewhat polar.  And 
being polar, they stick to the electron and when or IF they 
stick to the proton horizon, they do so with the other end 
of their polarity.  This leaves us with only one particle 
thingy to consider, instead of an anti-photon headache two.

So, that would mean a lebenty-leben photons in a heads down 
position at the magnetic or gravitational trough when stuck 
to an electron.  And a butts up position for the other 
lebenty-leben or more photons when hypothetically 
surrounding a proton or within the mass where the proton 
lives.

And that would imply that there is no such thing as an anti- 
photon involved in this physical aspect of reality.  Just 
plain old photons for both.

Or is it that the other anti-photons are already called to 
duty in other particle areas and only get to annilate the 
regular photons when they are shook loose?

Who knows?

In all probability, perhaps, even the questions are invalid.

Okay, shades of Star Trek, now we have an anti-photon 
torpedoes if we can shake them loose from duty.

You would think that if the anti-photon existed, that they 
would null (annilate) themselves in collision with a regular 
photon.  Energy release?  who knows.  my guess is no.  just 
a neutralization of charge, spin or whatever...  
joseph_sixpacks don't get into it that deep...
Ask somebody who knows.

<hr>

                      Michelson-Morley

Now, ahem... let me bring up my favorite subject.  The 
massless interlinking underlayer... :-)

Can the massless underlayer be composed of just interlinked 
photons?

The idea is that the transmission velocities are sort of a 
high speed forward lateral system. Velocity is limited by 
the resonance or is that frequency?  Can we deduce the 
wavelength by the velocity?  The frequencies and therefore 
the energies...?  ahhh... i'm losing it again, mind is going 
south on me... sigh...  

Not that photons are massless but...

well, anyway...  just an idea...

There seem to be enough of them to go around, between them 
and neutrinos.

How much of the 'missing mass' of the cosmos would these 
energy photons fill in?

Or do we even need to fill in the missing mass of the cosmos 
with all the supermassive albeit, currently theoretical 
Romeo's out there...  i have just read that they have 
discovered over 200 gravitational lensing systems out there. 
That's a lot of implied mass.  

Again, this is all twilight zone stuff when it comes to 
describing reality.

<hr>

          <b>The Photon Theory of Gravitation.</b>
               A new theory by Joseph_sixpack

Has a nice ring to it.  Let's call it that until the truth 
comes along.

File it under, "Ideas that lasted 20 minutes or more".  In 
my defense however, there currently doesn't appear to  be 
any alternate ideas.

<hr>

                 Matter as Compressed Dice

Now, let's go back to the cubic compression model of quantum 
mass, pour in a scrudle of photons, and see how the two 
concepts can be harmonized, or if the two start bristling, 
and end up not being able to be integrated.

What happens to all the photons when mass may be under so 
much pressure that it 'cubifies'? (new word).

Do they get squeezed out?  Or are they incorporated into the 
linked cubified  process?

If photons are the source of warped spacetime (gravity), (a 
big if) what is the configuration of these polar buttons 
going to have to be to effect such super powerful gravity.  
Needless to say, the subject of the mechanics of warped 
spacetime (gravity) isn't closed yet by a long shot.   

<hr>

<b>Anyhow, back to the 'carapace' shell of mass:  A  butts 
up (repulsive end) photon mass layer around all quantum mass 
might explain the sharp repulsive shell within matter.</b>

And that is why your hand hurts when you pound on the table 
and the reason why you can't push the spoon thru it.  The 
guilty party may be the photon and/or/maybe even, as a cya 
shot, the anti-photon!  Anyhow, something is doing 
something.

well...   let's see if we can't get some anti-gravity ideas 
out of this hypothesis and additionally, fold it into ultra 
hyper super duper massive black hole (big bang) stuff.  
jeez, there has to be a LOT of photons out there...

Empty space must just be afog with photons.

And finally, if the photon shell is what is adding or 
protecting, or shielding, the strong force within matter, 
the ability to strip away the photon shell with an ultra 
high magnetic stripper to make it easier to wack the heavier 
atoms.  And that might be the last genie that mankind lets 
out of the bottle.

If it is true that only a third of a penny of mass was 
coverted at Hiroshima.  What effect would occur with 
efficiencies much, much higher?

Hmmm, or better yet, how about using the stripper for 
peaceful uses for electric production, water desalination, 
heat production in cold areas, and etc.

Think that will happen?  yeah, right...

If any of the twilight zone theory above is approaching 
reality, i recommend we not go there.  Mankind is already in 
enough trouble as he is just wasting away his topsoil with 
the plow, letting the wind blow it away and wash it into 
streams.

The Department of Agriculture is saying we are losing 1-2% 
of it per year

Do your 'rule of 70' on that one...  We have already gone 
through 50% of our topsoil since the Nation was founded.

Fused green silica from fission devices really won't grow 
much, and fish don't like boiling water.

There are enough hugh dead zones in the ocean right now 
because of excess fertilizer use.  Is there ANY hope?...

<b>You living corpses who drive around in Buicks, thinking 
you are 'Part of God' are going to have to come up with 
solutions fast!</b>

<hr>

Anyhow, back to the subject:

So let's ask again:
     how far can a photon phot?
     just what is mass?
     what is radiation?
     what is energy?
     and just what is a photon?
     how does spacetime get warped?
     what is a photons roll in the universe?
     what creates the 'hard shell' in mass'?
            hey!  is energy an object or a condition?
                  f=ma?  is f e?

Where are real live honest physicists when you need them?

Okay, okay... it's time for my nap...

photons...  hmmm.  aren't photons what the sun spits out?  
and plants absorb...

<b>"The Photon Universe"</b>

Again, kind of got a nice ring to it...

What is amazing is that these little photonic corpuscles of 
ostensible light bringers could be/are/aren't? the source of 
hidden gravity.  

And, collectively, unchecked, probably even the immense 
black hole gravity and its darkness of our universe's 
history as well as the repulsive shell hardness and 
indifference of materials that prevents a soulful 
interchange.   

Water too, is not exempt from indifference.

And so the humble creature at the bottom of sea rejoices at 
life, and scuttles quickly back into its hole to sleep and 
wonder in its dreams that the objects of consciousness and 
life are truly mind boggling.

Yet all the while above, the dark silent denizens await the 
opportunity for the final accretion of their unknowing and 
witless quarry who, unaware, merrrily gambol in a sunlite 
meadow.
