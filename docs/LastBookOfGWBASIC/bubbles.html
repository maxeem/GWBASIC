update:  April 11, 2006  slight reorganize<br>
update:  April 07, 2006  added abstract<br>

<pre>Abstract:  The apparent filament nature of the cosmos is 
caused by the extended 'event horizons' of hypermassive 
black holes.  These monster black hole 'event horizons' 
extend far, far out for many light years, from the 
originating hard warped spacetime (gravitational) causing 
mass.

Stated otherwise, this hypothesis suggests therefore that 
massive volumes in space are apparently 'blacked' out due to 
the light retention ability of hypermassive objects.

The gravity from these objects is so severe that light years 
of the cosmos are seemingly void. Their presence is known 
only by the termination of the boundary of the light 
retaining event horizon.

Further obscuring the hypermassive black hole, is the fact 
that probably much of the light from behind the hypermassive 
black hole is gravitationally wrapped around the hidden 
sphere of darkness and appears as if it is actually in front 
of the event horizon.

One of the characteristics of gravitational 'light wrapping' 
of galaxies is the apparent reversal of the spiral 
direction.  What was once clockwise becomes counter- 
clockwise and what was once counter-clockwise becomes 
clockwise.

Try it.  Get an unused clear vinyl coffee can lid and paint 
a spiral galaxy on the lid.  Then pretend the coffee can is 
a black hole and run the painted lid in perpendicular orbit 
around the coffee can.  Notice how at the start, from your 
viewing position, the spiral direction is one way, then 
after the orbit wrap, the spiral apparently reverses as it 
is wrapped around the gravitational source. (the coffee can)

November 2004

Dear Reader,

What follows are just speculative theories at best,  and it 
is important to remember that.

                            Boo!

Distant from the scientific community, my information is 
just mere readsay and hearsay.  Analogous in another human 
area, for some people here on earth, our own bible is 
similarly, absent divine ear-banging, just readsay.

We are on earth, the place of testing, and the devil is in 
our midst patroling to and fro, and even owns some printing 
presses.  We call Him the "Father of Lies."  His lies are 
pervasive and all encompassing.  You don't have to look too 
far to see what troubles misinterpreting those 'divine' 
books have caused.  He has an easy job and doesn't really 
have to work very hard to send us to our doom.  DOOM!

Fortunately, scientific theories at least, don't get people 
burned at the stake in most parts of the world much anymore.    

Well, maybe for a while yet...

<hr>

                  And then there was noise

If you scientists think that the inadequately educated public 
generates a lot of "noise" (wrong science) about science, you 
haven't seen the "noise" generated by inadequately educated 
scientists about holy writ.  And i guess there is a lot of noise 
by the fundamentalists of all strips, but that is something that 
St. Augustine says to leave alone.  Leave the stups in their own 
soup.  Except St. Augustine says my street paraphrase in a lot 
nicer Christian fashion, as Saints are wont to do.

From my point of view, occasionally a good argument can be 
made that writ isn't holy, quite the opposite in fact.  Two 
opposing soldiers fighting for their God in a pitched battle 
are afterwords found dead, both reading the same bible.  
What's wrong with that picture?  But that is another 
subject.

In any event, the social problems are too complex for my 
little mind so i'll leave the hardcore political stuff to 
the brainiacs and evil central.

I recommend we just try and incorporate the "red letter" 
into our personalities as best we can to optimize the word 
being made flesh.

Most of us however screw up and end up being the flesh made 
word.

So we have to pray up a storm for God's Perfect Justice and 
God's Perfect Mercy and leave the fighting to those who are 
predisposed to darkness and willing to kill for lines in the 
sand.

<hr>

                         Start here

A good starting place for scientists of an agnostic or 
atheistic bent, is to wade into the 23/24th book of Saint 
Augustine and perhaps Dom Marmion, a Benedictine monk, 
Christological works.  There might be a lot less noise.

           Momma beat you with a stick if you bad

But trust the Universal Church and cast a suspicious eye on 
the church militant. That institution has been a around a 
LOT longer than we individuals have, waving our flags, and 
it has a very giant corpus of empirical data that backs up 
their policies given the raw material that they are obliged 
to work with i am told.  (there's that hearsay again...) but 
it makes sense.

Suffice to say that God is Mercifully and Perfectly Just.  
We all go to our final land of people who are just like us.  

Imagine spending the balance of your stay with people just 
like you.  The thieves go to the land of the thieves.  The 
schemers to the schemers, etc.  God is merciful, but He puts 
you just where you belong and nowhere else because He is 
perfectly Just.

In sum, the Good News is that God is Perfectly Just and the 
bad news is that God is Perfectly Just.

               Topsoil is gone with the wind

Now, everybody would be happy if you could ignore the Easter 
Island event on steroids that is currently happening to the 
earth.

With the topsoil of the earth being lost at the rate of 1% 
to 2% per year on a world wide basis, mankind has about 150 
years left according to the rule of 70.

And then there is the recent contamination of the oceans 
with plastics, with fisheries terminally exploited,

And all during this terrible destruction of the commons, the 
incense and candles are burning, and the priests are waving 
flour and water in the air and fondling little boy's pee- 
wees when they think no one is looking.

All this, without a single word from them about how we have 
to be responsible stewards of the planet for all time, for 
all generations.  And that the duty of agape extends to the 
future, to the past, as well as the present.

Not a word.  not a word.  not a word about eternal 
stewardship by the population at large.

And make no mistake.  In these incense burners hands, waving 
and blabbing, the Host remains flour and water.

The Host will only transubstantiate when our conduct is 
changed towards God in all human affairs in a TIMELESS 
fashion and our efforts at love and kindness is applied to 
the unborn future as well as the present and even the past.

I think the mystical body of the black hole called Evil 
Central, aka the mystical body of Satan aka "The Devil" owns 
a few printing presses, and we are a stupid, very stupid, 
hopelessly stupid, people well within the gravitational pull 
of evil so profound that it defies description.

So limited is my intellect that i can only offer prayer as a 
solution to the earth's inhabitants as a solution.  It is 
too much to expect any change in conduct by citizen joe 
sixpack.  i just don't see it happening.  One might as well 
just preach to a huge swarm of locusts pouring onto the 
earth.   

<hr>

                         Say what?

As an armchair theorist but not scientist, who had trouble 
with long division, carrying along and reasoning from a 
questionable corpus of not well understood information, 
containing possible enormous theological interdictions & 
social baggage, as well as the overlay of the possibility of 
suspicious resultant political and quasi-theocratic 
misinformation, disinformation, and possible downright lies, 
witness the activity of our own (the Romans) government and 
the lands of Egypt, the Greek islands and Persia, for 
example, makes finding the objective scientific truth and 
subject social policies engendered thereby, and thereto, a 
hard job, while watching our tiny lifeboat called "earth" 
sinking towards an Easter Island on steroids scenario and 
fate.

We've got about 150 years left at the outside as near as can 
be figured.  Probably more like 50 or so, before things 
really start sliding apart according to other guesses.  
Don't know, maybe that is what God wants for us sinners.

             Yes, it's true.  i was wrong once.

So in sum, if the information taken receipt of is correct as 
to the basic facts, i admit that there is still a swell   
probability that the resultant theories, hypotheses and 
deductions formed therefrom are still wrongly formed.  Time 
will tell...

                  Garbage in, Garbage out

And, if I have been informed incorrectly as to basic facts, 
then the hypothesis and conclusions based on them are ipso 
facto voided and really wrongly formed.  Operator error in 
the field of theoretical cosmology and/or theology cannot be 
ignored.  In that case:  As you were, keep consuming and 
chomping away at the planet until told to do otherwise.

<hr>

               Where did all the topsoil go?

Bright people once maintained that the earth was flat.

What the bright people didn't know, (well maybe they did...) 
was that hardly a soul knew what they were talking about.  

Of course, every erstwhile metaphysician knows that the 
earth is flat.

Everybody knows that.

Not literally flat of course, but metaphysically flat with 
no height, no perspective, no vision of the horizon, no 
vision of duties to the future, to the past, morally flat, 
socially flat, spiritually flat, unable to ascertain what 
will come, unable to ascertain what course of conduct to 
pursue.

In short, ignorant and stupid as a stump.  Just falucking farm 
animal stupid. 

<hr>
              Are those Clouds, Mists or Fog?

And nowadays, many are beginning to suspect that the heavens 
may be somewhat flat as well.  But that is another subject, 
based on an entire different set of definitions that go back 
to the Easter Island on steroids scenario that is occuring 
on the earth as you read this...

The net question is:

Why are the Heavens allowing us to consume the earth with no 
end in sight?  There are some frightening tenative answers 
based on the end being in sight, but...    

              Cheer up, things could be worse

None of these speculative theories set forth below make us 
bigger or better, either individually or as a race.  Indeed, 
our infinitesimal presence in the cosmos is made even 
smaller.

<hr>

                      So i cheered up
                 I am alive!  so now what?

Our station, cosmoswise speaking, is a reality.  We can 
contemplate upon the fact that even in our tiny temporary 
time of existence, the Cosmos or God, (your choice) has 
formed us as contemplative creatures capable of examining 
our universe and mediating on what we have found.  And what 
we, as a species and the cosmos may be, or might become, or 
not become.

We exist as the Cosmos consciousness and we exist at the 
Cosmos sufferance.

                         Going up?

Consider the fact that the universe can contemplate itself 
and its existence thru us!  Is it not a small honor to be 
part of the Universe's consciousness, even if for a very 
short time.

We can argue that our station is brief, but elevated.

The universe can see itself thru us.

That means that the universe is LIVING!

That means that it also knows that some parts of it (us) are 
doing doo-doo on its cognizant cells.

That means that anti-bodies may be dispatched.

<hr>

                       What is Truth?              P. Pilate

Truth, in all its manifestations, in all its dimensions and 
elements, besides our stunted ability towards creating 
systems of concern (love and the imitative processes of 
God), is the only thing that we should be concerned with, or 
cogniscent of, as thoughtful creatures of the universe.

Unfortunately, discerning the truth, has to be applied with 
respect to our population with its propensities towards 
stupidity and excess as well.  Nice to fathom the Cosmos's 
truth, but our species truth and its solutions needs to be 
fathomed as well.

                   The Leftovers of Earth

To make matters worse, this universal love or concern has to 
extend itself to the as yet to the great unborn portion of 
humanity following us in the far, far, future.  Will they, 
with our timeless disconsideration of their existence, be 
able to exist on what will be left over of the earth from 
our malignant dark and ungodly stewardship.

                 What voices distant weep?

Can we hear the voices of lament from our own children?

Can we hear the cries from the earth's future?

Can we hear the cries from those billions of human souls who 
now try to exist on a near sterile leftover planet?  

Look!  All of it was consumed within our imitative "God" 
process?

We are sort of like a weird houseplant that keeps throwing 
its own soil out of the pot, ignorant of its own self 
destructing activity, ignorant of the activities fatal 
consequences.  Unlike even, the alcoholic, who may know that 
what he is doing will make him die.

One last sentence:
whenever you see the word "I" or "i" you can substitute the 
name "Joe Sixpacks", or your own name for that matter.

Joe Sixpacks have a job to do.  We have to take it upon 
ourselves to be the voice that represents the future's great 
unborn, those billions of souls from the future who have no 
present voice and are now yet silent within the blind 
activities of mankind's current theo-jurassic era.

Christ is of course still the contemporaneous and eternal 
answer for a solution, but i am beginning to suspect that 
even He suffers from myopia and needs glasses to see the 
starving centuries and empty eons ahead.  Granted, today's 
problems are mind-boggling enough for sure.

There are solutions of course, but not likely to be thought 
out by the likes of a joseph_sixpack.  My current best 
solution is almost total poverty and a life closer to the 
animals, who despite their lesser status, cannot be accused 
of despoiling the planet's topsoil and oceans with the plow 
and chainsaw and plastics, but tend to live within the 
current permissable equilibrium.  Frankly, perfect Justice 
towards the future turns out to be not too desirable either 
to a joseph_sixpack. but...

This is hardly going to be a popular undertaking by those 
who want a new blue Buick and fourteen kids, and frankly, it 
doesn't appeal to me either.  But Future Justice is Future 
Justice.  What to do?  What to do?  Joe Sixpacks don't have 
a solution to lack of sustainability issues, indeed, joe 
sixpacks don't have solutions to most anything...  

I plead with those in charge of an empty-minded humanity to 
cease the destruction of future earth, so that those who are 
to come, will have a place, upon which to love and practice 
justice.  Do not allow the currently growing deserts and 
altering oceans to evict mankind for his centuries and 
centuries of short-sightedness.

             End of Diatribunal Preface or Forward

                  Back to Bubbles in Space

Abstract:
This is the theory given earlier that postulates that 
hypermassive and supermassive black holes, that is, those 
that can retain light unto itself, are the real common 
citizen of the cosmos.  And with the following hypothesis, 
"BUBBLES" is given that they too are, the source or cause of 
the apparent vacuous 'bubbles' in space which create a 
filament appearance to the Cosmos as their event horizon, 
extending many light years out from the source gravitational 
mass appears like an empty bubble...which it is not.

<hr>

To begin:
If i remember correctly, the latest (well, relatively 
latest) theme from certain professional astronomers mapping 
star distances and locations using and depending upon the 
red shift techiques, was that the glaxies of the cosmos 
seemed to be arranged around huge dark and empty bubble like 
boundary areas. (this hypothesis contends that they may be 
dark, but they are certainly not empty...)

                           duh...

But no one knew why, or how, the empty and dark bubble like 
areas came to be with with the mass of the universe arranged 
in such a perplexing manner.  The stars, galaxies, quasars, 
pulsars, and other matter of the universe, were seemingly 
packed filament like, mostly in between the massive 
volume/area of the nothingness of the empty bubbles.

                        duh, duh...

A couple of days ago, plopped down, and sitting and staring 
out the windows of my favorite coffee house, engaged in my 
usual activity of continually dropping a plastic stirring 
spoon onto the table and watching it, asking the same 
questions, over and over again: 

1.)  Why does the spoon fall?

2.)  What makes it fall?

3.)  How can it fall?

4.)  What mechanisms are involved in falling?
     (ignore warped spacetime for right now)
5.)  Why does the spoon stop falling?

6.)  Why does the spoon bounce?

7.)  Why does it slide or roll?

Then, all of a sudden!
                          Eureka!

                        or modernly,
                         Gadzooks!

                       or presently,
                         Jeepers!

Nursing my Cafe Au Lait, and pondering the imponderable 
mysteries of gravitation and the universe as usual when not 
looking at young ladies and bemoaning my old age, the 
solution (well, a possible explanation at least...) came to 
me as to one of the questions i had been pondering, (not 
related directly to any of the above). which is typical...

                          hmmm...

The solution was so simple that, after a while, i couldn't 
believe that no one, that i had read as yet, had posited or 
published an answer to explain the seemingly unusual 
phenomenon.

                 Yet another original idea...

but i am sure the idea is out there somewhere, as my first 
great breakthru and "original idea" establishing the 
gravitationally retaining black hole threshold in terms of 
solar mass, turned out to be only 200 years old - actually 
my great idea was slighty wrong anyhow, but that is another 
subject...

           Author's demand for Honorary Doctorate

Note:  A somewhat LARGER opus following this one as soon as 
i get the outline of the paper straightened out.  For this, 
i want my honorary Doctorate in Theoretical Daydreaming.

a 25 word, er... paragraph, er... page, er... chapter, 
synopsis follows:  (this opus dopus may be it)

<hr>

                          The Dirt Clod

Okay, here we go... Consider a mass in space so huge that it 
has a gravitational escape velocity so large that it is some 
multiple of "c".  Of course, i can hear the chorus now, 
"Nothing can go faster than c!"

Now i currently accept and agree with the current party line 
that a multiple of c can never be attained by radiation.  
what do i know?  i am not going to race alongside radiation 
with a stopwatch.  

Solid matter however, may not be bound by such a limitation, 
and may be another issue completely but even that is in 
contention.

But let's continue...  Joe Sixpacks (i) have the suspicion 
that solid matter, although basically a waveform itself may 
be able to exceed c and if it does, it just flat ass 
disappears from view if it is going away from you ala 
starwars hyperdrive.  And if it is coming towards you?  i am 
still thinking about the shock wave on that one.
            
                          Speedy c

Now "c", which for the normal readers who may not know, or 
have any reason to care, and thereby having proved their 
sanity, is currently used by the sciencing crowd as notation 
for the maximum velocity (about 186,000 miles/second) that 
light (or other radiation) can attain in a vacuum (space).

Physicists presume, well i guess, have proven, that the 
velocity "c" can never be exceeded. So radiation of any 
type, visible or invisible (wavelength/frequency) could NOT 
escape the gravitational pull of such a huge mass in space.  
So a much larger 64c escape velocity generated from a much 
larger mass, is an impossibility or, stated otherwise, a 
physical unreality.
<hr>

      Yet another consideration or flimsy hypothesis:

                    Coo-coo, coo-coo...

Now before we get too far, let me suggest another 
hypothesis:

The very remote possibility exists that the radiation 
retention ability, that is the gravitational power of black 
holes to warp spacetime, may be interdicted by the radiation 
retaining supermass being simply "too hot" or energetic to 
effect the process of generating a gravitational field 
(warping spacetime)  
   See the <a href="snotstdm.html">Snot</a> Standard Model

                      Too hot to trot

That is to say, the spacetime warpage may instantly cease 
when particle (waveform) resonance moves so fast, it passes 
the threshold of being able to maintain its polar additive 
properties.

Of course the instant question is:  How can this happen?  
well, the only thing i can think of is a condition of 
overlapping polarities must start to exist and the gravity 
causing process starts slipping or oscillating between 
maximum gravity and diminished gravity.

                   Let me reexplain that.

A second possibility may be that (Read the SNOT standard 
model of this series of The Universe according to Joe 
Sixpack) the little cubes of quantum waveform's corners 
start to become so compressed that they encroach on each 
other.  Under "normal" gravitational conditions this never 
happens but under extreme pressures found in a radiation 
retaining system the diagonals of the quantum cube are 
crushed/pushed into, and past, one another.  So instead of 
linking with full additive effect, their linkage is pushed 
together and past the optimal warped spacetime generating 
point.  And therefore are not interlocked into the other's 
cube waveforms preventing or greatly lessening the net 
effective linkage.  They could link with substantially less 
gravitational effectiveness greatly reducing gravitation. 
How far this process can go is anybody's guess.

The repulsive force could come into play here and kick ass 
on the whole ballgame with a massive repulsive event.

<hr>

              Back to the Aether for a second

okay, okay, cut me some slack here for a minute...

Ahem... in non-warped spacetime talk, the gravalumps 
(gravitrons) get "out of synch" for hookup or connection to 
the massless carrying or propagating spacetime ether".  I 
don't expect ANY scientist to agree to that hypothesis, but 
it keeps popping up in the damnedest places.

Either there is not an "ether" and the cubic gravalumps 
additively warp spacetime themselves or there is an linking 
massless underlayer creating the gravitational field 
conditions.

<hr>

                     back to the candle
          (a pre-photon mass discovery discussion)

Let me try again to explain briefly about this massless 
"ether".  But more on this later in the next century.  

Consider a candle burning.  The candle emits light in a 
spherical fashion, er... as an ever diminishing field with 
distance.  it is propagating light "waves".  Bet you didn't 
know that huh?  okay, bear with me.

                  the light is still there

That is, if you walk all around the candle, you continually 
just see a bright spot as the oxidation or burning process 
consumes wax and wick.

Now to say that photons, argued to have a rest mass of zero, 
are being emitted from the candle at the speed of light is 
to suggest a gazillion, gazillion photons emanating in all 
directions from the humble candle and to obliquely raise the 
suggestion that the photons could well saturate the entire 
universe from just the one candle given enough time, wax and 
wick.

An interesting side spectulation is:
Do photons finally peter out and lose more and more energy 
and become particles again?  Just how far can a photon phot?  
And while i am on the subject, just what the hell really, is 
a photon anyway?

                    Spherical resonance

My current best guess or suggestion is:  that the particle 
activities (hadron, quarks & other unknown denizens) of the 
burning process going on are creating a spherical pinpoint 
of an almost quantum tiny inward-outward resonance of a 
massless linking or propagating ether, a resonance somewhat 
analogous to alternating current, that is, the photons polar 
linkage just allows a back and forth resonance, albeit in a 
spherical fashion, of some quantum period/wavelength 
visible, infrared, in space, which when the resonance 
(oscillations) hits the retina of the eye, causes the retina 
to shake an electron or something even smaller loose and 
transmit a signal to the brain and it "sees" the light;  
under this theory there are no photons, just a resonance 
process which fieldlike, fades out with distance but creates 
no new photon particles. 

(how's that for one sentence?  My english teacher must be 
shrieking by now. :-)  i was the comma splice king in junior 
college.  Sorry Dr. Doyle.)

       the hot particle connects to the leg bone

Now, let me explain again about this spherical resonance 
theory.  It is a source pinpoint reacting event that sets 
off a field with all the usual field properties and if 
anything, is probably composed of something wussy and 
wavelike, like the massless newtrinos which wavelike, issue 
forth. (it there something wrong with that sentence?) 

And it is this theory of a massless propagating underlayer, 
relevant to extreme gravitation of black holes that gets 
interfered with, and rendered ineffecive, and renders 
ineffective, the normal physical processes of the polar 
linking mechanism that effect field gravitation, the field  
radiation of visible light, and all other radiation 
energies.  Anyhow, enough of this weird somewhat speculative 
theory for awhile, and back to the subject at hand.
<hr>
Oops!  but thirdly, yet another repeat discussion before i 
forget, that is related to the above:

Can the Spherical resonance theory of the gravitational 
process (warped spacetime) be disintegrated by excessive 
temperatures and pressures due to super hypermass 
conditions, and result in a exteme supermassive big-bang 
type distribution?

That would mean that once a supermassive hole got to its 
critical compression pressure size, the gravity (warped 
spacetime) causing process would collapse past the 
operational interlink point and the repulsive forces within 
the black hole would take over and explode at some finite 
velocity.

I like that idea a lot better than hot singularity of a big 
"onetime" bang of something from nothing and then a fade out 
and then a "light no more" situation.  But the Universe+ may 
be the better idea for causing the big bang or actually, the 
big redistribution, following a longterm and massive 
accretion period.  There are limits to intuition for sure...

<hr>

                  Batteries not included:

Stuff for StarWars!
Oooh!  a gravity disintergration gun!  neat!  By squirting 
massive unlimited heat into the center of a planet you can 
cause its gravitation processes to collapse and 
disintergrate and hock goobers!  Ah, but we need a certain 
crystal! and some batteries.. and a switch.

Boy, this thing is turning into science fiction fodder 
fast...  :-)

(er... fred, they have already done that...)

Anyhow... Now back to our supermassive black hole 
discussion.

End of aside.

<hr>

                Okay we are serious again...

back to humongous event horizons.

To continue:

And say for discussion purposes, this huge mass in space has 
a very powerful gravitational field whose escape velocity 
would require a theoretical albeit unreachable 64 times the 
speed of light to escape from at the surface of the mass. 

Lessening of course, as you got further and further away 
from the object's real surface in space, until the object in 
space could be radiationally, so to speak, be escaped from, 
that is, it could be escaped from when the net effective 
escape velocity dropped with distance away, somewhat below 
the "speed of light".

Now this is a huge mass to the average Joe Sixpack, but the 
Universe+ hypothesis submits, that as size goes, this is 
just a little dirt clump in the Cosmotic (a new word?) scale 
of things; with solar masses of dirt clods (mass) up in the 
millions or billions or billions of billions in some 
outlying parts of the universe at the edge of its 
detectability.

Okay, the question we have been leading to is:

At what point from the supermassive black hole would the 
"event horizon" of the mass with the 64c escape velocity 
appear?

Stated another way:

What's the final non-visual diameter of the event horizon of 
an object whose surface escape velocity would be 64c but 
now, way out in space when the escape velocity drops to a 
mere c or whose escape velocity is still a tad over or under 
the value of 'c'?  Simple math, right?

Remember, the real subject is how big is the event horizon 
of supermassive black holes with solar masses in the 
millions and billions and billions of billions and 
incidentally, how big can big get?  For example, the little 
Norma Cluster, just a lamb's shake away is only 
50,000,000,000,000,000 solar masses.

Another question is:  Is there a limit to gravitation, 
beyond which addition mass will not increase the gravity?  
But more on that later.

<hr>

Okay, back to the subject of the black hole's event horizon 
which has a 64c escape velocity at the hard surface:

Well... intuitively, again, it might extend out to where the 
gravitational escape velocity dwindles down to just c, which 
doing the inversely proportional thing with respect to 
gravity, would be quite a distance away. Can we ever come up 
with a firm number for the diameter of an event horizon?

Probably not, as the effective dimension of the event 
horizon or the gravitational influence of any mass is 
dependent, it appears, on its density, temperature, and 
therefore, internal pressures which change with changing 
amounts of mass, heat and pressure. It appears to be a just 
a guessing game of approximate numbers with even the 
tolerance values unknown.

Two objects, generating event horizons, may have the same 
apparent event horizon diameter but be somewhat different 
internally, creating a suspicion about the legitimacy of the 
"standard candle" as being a good arbiter of determining 
distance.  The candle is suspect or at least, somewhat 
wobbly.  But more on that headache later...

<hr>

Let's ignore the currently accepted party line 'fact' that 
nothing can travel faster than the speed of light which, 
using standard notation, is abbreviated to 'c'.  So 
currently, a '64 times c' escape velocity is in reality, 
quite meaningless to our current scientists, in so far as 
developing any real or potential velocity of that magnitude 
to allow raditation to 'escape'.

Notwithstanding the 64c escape velocity as being a 
practically meaningless number, it may have other 
unsuspected relevance.

Looking at this example of supermassive object gravitational 
characteristics, we see that there is a very hot, hard, (it 
is hard because it is under a lot of compression) solid core 
of mass whose escape velocity is "64c" and another invisible 
boundary far, far, out from the hard surface whose escape 
velocity finally falls to a mere value of c; the value of 
which is the famous 186,000 miles per second.

Looking at the spherical edge of the event horizon, the 
whole thing appears to be just not there.

But don't get too close, or go inside the event horizon or 
even close to the thing's very distant escape velocity that 
is higher than you tiny spacaship.  If you do, you are 
doomed, Doomed! to be quark soup, hitting the core at near 
light speed after a long, albeit, short journey from the 
edge of the event horizon to the hard 64c escape velocity 
surface.  And according to the spacetime physicists, you 
will be a bit longer when you hit the surface. :-)

Okay, that said, can we presume now that there is nothing 
between the 64c escape velocity surface of the mass and the 
c escape velocity boundary layer (visible event horizon) 
except a LOT of retained radiation (remember my "superdirt" 
from the Universe+ v1.020 discussion) and absolutely no 
stationary matter of any type whatsoever, it all being 
pulled within the surface of the 64c mass object.

IF
 the system is a binary one of sufficient different masses 
and
IF
 there is NO internal radiation/particle evaporation out any 
zero gravity port occuring due to unequal masses of the 
binary system which create an interdicting zero gravity 
"wok" effect to the port which would disallow any escape of 
radiation or mass due to its elimination of the zero gravity 
port,
THEN
 there may be a very lot of retained radiation.  Most of 
which may be very close to the hard surface ultra high 
gravity area and far away from the distant 'c' event horizon 
boundary layers and
IF
 the radiation itself isn't absorbed or accretted by the 
binary black hole system.

An aside:
         What is not seen can be a nasty surprize.
Even the radiation, if gravitationally retained, would be 
wrapped around the very high 64c mass and not be too close 
to the c event horizon/boundary layer.  So you would enter 
the binary black hole system as just empty space with no 
knowledge or possible change in ambient radiation levels, 
er, for a while at least... definitely a sneaky event...

There will be no warning, no announcement.  Like a moth in a 
spiders web, you can only wait your turn for oblivion.  Such 
are the Black Holes of our Universe. 

<hr>

                       Size matters:

Now our object under discussion, a 64c escape velocity mass 
for example, would consist of a mere 32,000 solar masses, 
plus or minus a few depending on density and pressures. This 
is not an unimaginable dirt clod for space, in fact, my 
guess is that it would be comparatively tiny when measured 
against the one million, billion or trillion and 
quadrillions and higher solar mass objects theoretically 
conceived to be out there with 'event horizon' diameters in 
the many millions of light years!  Our own tiny Norma 
Cluster, our destiny, has a mere 50 quadrillion solar 
masses.

Each supermasive object in space would have a unique, 
albeit, possibly ever-changing radius, diameter & volume 
value depending on just what is going on inside and what is 
outside going inside.

In assigning a numeric or dimensional value to the "visible" 
radius of any black hole, lets use RRR for now, short for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
(Radiation Retaining/Retention Radius) for discussion 
purposes, which is NOT to be confused with the actual radius 
of the super massive black hole's actual internal mass 
boundaries, which would be a much smaller value.

Now the distance of RRR always extends out to the simple, 
plain, c escape velocity boundary area. Or stated otherwise, 
the RRR value would be the EFFECTIVE radius of the diameter 
of the 'event horizon' sphere for any black hole.

If you go inside that value, or are even close enough that 
its escape velocity is faster than the speed of your rocket 
ship, you are history, soon to become part of a very hot 
quark soup. How hot? Real hot!

<hr>

                        Other Shapes

Uhhh... the shape of things, (lets call them spherical 
abberations) changes a bit when there is a binary or greater 
number (trinary, quatenary & etc.) of mass objects in mutual 
orbit generating a black hole but let's ignore those for 
now.

                            Summing up

In summary then, the theory exists that a mass with a 64c 
escape velocity, would be a black hole and would appear to 
be a much, much, larger sphere than its smaller causitive 
internal mass would be.

If the 64c mass is a binary, tertiary, quatenary black hole 
with functioning zero gravity evaporating "ports", the 
situation might change a bit as the internal mass is 
evaporated out as high and low energy radiation into the 
empty area between the 64c matter boundary and the RRR c 
boundary. The 64c eventually goes down to 63, then 62 and so 
on, due to internal leakage with the internally 
gravitationally retained radiation becoming more and more 
intense within the RRR as it closed down in diameter, 
possibly even with some reabsorption of direct hit radiation 
reestablishing some particulate matter.

But this is partical physics here and an even higher 
spectculative area on my part.

<hr>  

Coinciding with the decreasing mass, the RRR shrinks to a 
smaller and smaller RRR value to reflect the internal mass 
realities and therefore, the "event horizon" boundary sphere 
shrinks along with it.

<hr>

            Now we have a minor problem Houston:

Since the radiation from the evaporating mass is being 
gravitationally retained, can we say then that the 64c black 
hole has lost no mass whatsoever, and therefore there won't 
be any shrinkage of the RRR even though the internal matter 
(quarks and glueons) is escaping though the zero gravity 
ports but not past the event horizon?

               Hmmm... problems, problems...

And what happens when the original internal mass goes below 
even the minor theoretically linear 502 (or 483) solar mass 
requirement to retain visible radiations?

                     Yet another aside:

By the way, this 502 value is simply arrived at by dividing 
the escape velocity from our own sun into the velocity of 
light.

The 502 number may be way too high.

Some parameters yield the value of 483 as the escape 
velocity for radiation retention.

However, my best guess, and it is just a guess, gives the 
seat of the pants number of 276.

That number, instinctively, is probably a bit closer, but it 
is still a guess, if 'quantum' mass is pushed together and 
increases in pressure and therefore gravitation generating 
effectiveness because of the inverse square relationship due 
to pressure is accounted for.

                      But back again:

Will the retained gravitational radiation take the place of 
the evaporated mass and still give us a 32,000 solar mass 
gravitational object with no radiation release?

The solution to the conundrum seems to be in the density of 
the gravalumps (new term) within radiation, verses the 
closeness of the gravalumps in the original matter. In the 
original matter the pressures press the gravalumps closer 
together and they become more effective in generating warped 
spacetime.

Now before everybody starts shrieking, that there are no 
gravalumps in radiation let me state that if radiation can 
be gravitationally retained, then ipso facto, there must be 
an effective gravalump or gravalumplike aspect in the 
radiation, but you can call it whatever you want:  
gravitrons, quantum this or that and etc.  If radiation 
cannot be gravitationally retained then there is no such 
thing as a black hole.  THEREFORE radiation has mass.  
Albeit probably only around 3mv or less or even lesser than 
less.  :-)  but some.

Don't ask me what its quantum properties of inflight 
radiation are, i haven't the faintest. Our understanding of 
mass (matter) is so defective that we are still in the wave- 
particle duality stage of realization (well, at least mine 
is...) and still awaiting a final resolution of the issue. 

And while we are at it, why does mass or radiation exist at 
all anyhow? Well, let's skip that one too for now, i am in 
over my head enough now...

<hr>

                      Huh?  Say what?

Even though the number of gravalumps are the same within our 
64c body, their gravitational ability to warp spacetime 
effectiveness changes from matter (dirt), to radiation 
(superdirt) due to compression and therefore the escape 
velocity drops when matter of equal mass is in radiation 
form.

Plus there might be a massive change in the temperature of 
the gravalump radiation, verses the original status of the 
gravalump matter within the original evaporating 64c object. 
The radiation gravalump being much colder than the matter 
gravalump once released from the main mass further dropping 
gravitation as the resonant gravalump slows down in its 
unfolded velocity.

So all in all, it seems that the firecracker will go off 
when the escape velocity falls to below 'c".

                     Back to the issue:

Now when the internal evaporating mass of this supermassive 
object approaches a final low mass which would generate an 
escape velocity of only c, and soon below c, down from 64c, 
all the retained radiation is released at once as the escape 
velocity finally drops below c due to the ever evaporating 
and still very hot internal mass.

What happens when the escape velocity drops below c?
Voila! your common everyday nova. As the high energy zips 
through the attracted dust and other incoming mass, the 
theory goes that photons start to get ripped off and 
generates light.  Another theory is that the photons are 
themselves released.

Not so, i think, with the lower energy radiation to generate 
photons, but as infrared, radio, etc. it putt-putts out too, 
less energized perhaps, and possibly even carrying old Magum 
P.I., I Love Lucy, and M.A.S.H. television reruns.

Question: Are they still copyrighted after a billion years?

Setti is probably missing a bet.  They should try and 
convert some of those x-ray signals from space into our T.V. 
signals.  No telling what commercials they may catch on the 
new zumphflow 168 toothbrush for a brighter mouth of 200 
teeth. 

                       What's left?

Well, after our Novanic explosion, we have two or more 
objects in ultrafast orbit around one another. (hmmm... can 
you orbit not around one another?) Where is my english 
teacher when i need her... Dr. Doyle! Where are you?

The rotational orbital velocity and the size of the greatly 
shrunken residual objects still defy imagination. It's now a 
quasar or pulsar beating at velocities near c with 
incredible centrifugal forces. Don't even think of getting 
anywhere near it.

<hr>

                     Yet another aside:
   Navigation using black holes as velocity accelerators

It would seem possible that a close orbit to any high 
gravity object, not just black holes, would lend itself to 
slingshot acceleration technolgy.

The main issues with using black holes as accelerators would 
be to keep the acceleration, probably a large fraction of c, 
from coating the inside of the spaceship with the remains of 
the now liquid occupants as the accelerating centifugal g- 
forces took over.  (star wars people, are you listening?)

Even if sucessful, how now are you going to slow the damn 
thing down or even manuver left or right to avoid bonking 
your destination at speeds. Let's say we want to go to 
Andromeda. Okay on the approach, how do we slow down? Well, 
obviously by using a black hole to slow down. How do you do 
that?

Glad it's not my problem. End of discussion.
<hr>

          But back to our original 64c black hole:

Now pretend we are in our little red spaceship sports wagon 
approaching this monsterous many light year diametered 
"black hole" and unbeknowst to us, are accelerating towards 
its edge just about to slip through the extended event 
horizon.

Now earlier on my part, the thought was that when the event 
horizon was penetrated, you were instant quark soup or at 
least destined to be so.

Apparently, now, this may not be exactly true.

The second hypothesis is that you are is hit by a ton of 
radiation (if it is not kept close to the hard core by 
gravitation upon entry into the event horizon, sort of like 
walking into a super microwave.

you have just entered the yard so to speak and have a way to 
go yet to get the red hot house.

<hr>

The third hypothesis is that you won't notice anything 
unusual for a while as you pass into the event horizon, as 
most, if not all of the radiation is tightly wrapped around 
the 64c escape velocity mass.  But as you approach the '64c' 
hard surface, then you hit the radiation just prior to 
hitting the surface itself. 

a side question is:
How much of the radiation is reabsorbed by the causitive 
masses buried at the center of the black hole, if indeed any 
is... 

<hr>

Anyhow, what is posited here is in fact, a new conceptual 
theoretical stucture in the cosmos, something we might call 
an "energy hole". Or even a "Black Energy hole" That is 
composed of the "sea" of retained radiation wrapped on top 
of the underlying evaporating super hot quarked mass.

And that is why the universe appears to be a bubbly 
diaphanaeous cosmos.

What we are looking at is a LOT of invisible, very large, 
(well in the many light year range) black matter and energy 
holes, extending light years outward from the central 
gravitational source.

These appear to be "the" common citizen of the cosmos.

You DON'T want to be around one of those things if it goes 
off...

Now the e-holes come in all sizes whose existence ends when 
the gravitational escape velocity goes below c.

Some are so huge that it is doubtful that they will ever 
end. But it all depends on the functioning geometry of the 
causes of internal evaporation.

Some gravitational systems are so huge that even at 
250,000,000 light years away they still pull in and 
accelerate 200 or 300 other "close by" galaxies toward them 
at velocities of 1,000,000 miles per hour and with 
increasing measureable velocity as they get closer and 
closer by the decade. 

Gravitational lensing of course, would be rampant around 
such objects. even bending light from galaxies behind, and 
on the side, to wrap to the front of the gravitational 
object, possibly even blue shifting it. In a sense 
disguising, from a vast distance at least, the ever 
accelerating approach to the local group of galaxies.

End of paper.

<hr>

Well, feel free to pass this one on to anyone that can offer 
rebuttals or even use the concepts as being invalid as "bad" 
science to the point of "noise" in any classroom 
environment.  Excuse my uneducated particle physics 
terminology but i really like the term "gravalumps"... :-)

Anyhow,that is why no one is turning off the bubble 
machine...

The universe is composed of hypermassive and supermassive 
blackholes generating huge (lightyear diameter) apparently 
empty "bubbles".  But they are not empty.  Don't even think 
of taking a shortcut across one because of an apparent clear 
path to avoid dust, rocks, asteroids and your wife's 
biscuits.

<hr>

If, even many light years away from the edge of the  
hypermassive black hole's event horizon, you in your little 
spacaship are putt-putting along at your ships maximum speed 
of 40,000 earth miles per hour, and the escape velocity of 
the hypermassive black hole at that point is 40,001 miles 
per hour, you may not be aware at that time that you are now 
history. 

Respectfully, it is submitted that you consider them the 
"Venus Flytraps" of space travel.  Be careful when you try 
and leave the earth.  They are all out there waiting.  They 
will not warn.  They will not inform.  They just wait and 
let gravity do the job for them.

And that is why the sky is dark between the stars at night.

The paradox of the dark night sky has been answered.
