<pre>Abstract:  The problems with a Joseph_Sixpack intuition is 
that from time to time, paradoxes rise up from his mud 
thinking that expressly question whether his understanding 
of the subject matter of his blither is on track.

Stated otherwise, the paradoxes that arise suggest factual 
foundation errors that built the premises for his tentative 
conclusions.

This 'chapter' shows up a nasty paradox, perhaps, in fact, 
the paradox may be even non-existent, further discrediting 
joe's intuitive thinking.  Or even worse, the paradox is a 
reality...

<hr>
                   Anyhow, here it is...

premise #1:

In an earlier chapter there was the written speculation 
that:

--- If mass under extreme TIME dilation due  to exceptional 
gravity (warped spacetime) can actually stop the processes 
of TIME, then it would follow, or would it? that may be the 
main issue here, that all the 'processes' within the 
'stopped' mass itself would come to a halt comparative to 
the 'undilated' spacetime areas external to the TIME 
dilation environment.

The inference here is, that all the processes within the 
particles making up protons would come to a stop as well, if 
TIME stopped.

In short, it is postulated that the protons and particles 
within would vanish to something else because all the energy 
making up the apparent mass would cease to create the 
necessary fields that give property to mass.  The mass would 
not completely vanish... just vanish to something else.  
Contrariwise, everything would continue to exist, albeit at 
the newer stopped dilated time environment

Restated again, where there is no movement within particles, 
no fields that were generated from the movement can exist.  
Or at least, looking at it another way, they lose their 
effectivity.

So, from that we can deduce that any accreted mass within a 
black hole would have its 'time' stopped and therefore not 
generate any fields.  Including the ability to create warped 
spacetime (gravity)...

That gives us a gravitational-less black hole with no 
apparent abiltiy to warp spacetime because all the mass 
within has no 'time' value...

er... this is confusing to a joe...

But we all know that black holes create warped spacetime 
(gravity) and do it in spades.

That means then that even though time has stopped apparently 
from an external point of view, the slowing of time withing 
the black hole apparently doesn't affect the field 
generation properties of the dilated mass particles with 
respect to non-dilated time.

perplexing what?

Now... This immediately creates the suspicion that TIME is 
not dilated at all within a black hole, because gravity 
still continues to exist that is creating an escape velocity 
probably in excess of c...  sigh...

Ok... so maybe time doesn't dilate at all because the black 
holes haven't lost their ability to create humongous gravity 
(or warp spacetime if you prefer).

In a feeble joe mind, that puts some of Einstein's stuff 
under high suspicion.

A scenario that currently isn't likely to be accepted as any 
exposition of reality by today's physicists.
     
So... either extreme warped spacetime stopping TIME doesn't 
stop the creation of the fields that create warped spacetime 

duh... it wouldn't be there if it wasn't there scenario...

or

gravity isn't a field after all, but... mass does dimple 
something...   sigh...

or

time isn't dilated by gravity (warped spacetime then doesn't 
warp...   sigh...)  a fine kettle of fish...
      
<hr>

Anyhow, it is clear that joe doesn't have full (modestly 
speaking) grasp of General or Special theory.  A situation 
which shouldn't surprise you.  a joe is a joe is a joe...

human intuition may occasionally hit the windshield.

So... what does it mean when the pros say that TIME stops 
by dilation when the escape velocity exceeds c in a black 
hole?  What stops?  What can stop?  It appears at first 
glance that field generation doesn't stop, even though, 
theoretically, according to joe's thinking, it should.

i don't know, but maybe that is why i heard that Einstein 
worked so hard the rest of his life to disprove his own 
theories...

To be sure, the main men physicists, understand this stuff 
at least several orders of magnitude better than a joe. 

Anyhow... thought i would run it by you.

You figure it out.

go ask them.

<hr>

                             so

How about this one?  A new theory about the type 1 Nova!

If time dilates to zero in black holes and mass tags along 
and its fields drop to zero then the black holes have no 
gravity but would come apart rapidly 'explode' when the 
fields went to zero.

And as dilation continued to reduce the particles would 
continue to pick up field energies with, at this time, 
unknown effects.

Would they instantly reaccrete?  or contrarily, 'explode'?

So now we have a new theoretical model of supernovas to 
think about.

But after a nova 'explodes' could a black hole or a couple 
of black holes be left behind or would the whole basketball 
of balooey go up in a shower of particles, photons, protons, 
neutrons, electrons, and other miscellaneous egg and sausage 
particle stuff leaving nothing behind?

Well, that didn't happen with the nova of 1064.  There are 
still two whizzing beepers sending out beeps at 30 
beeps/second left over after that one.  Figure out that 
orbit speed.

Summarily, the yet another hypothesis from the black hole 
lagoon that is created is that TIME doesn't dilate with 
increases in mass that create an escape velocity approaching 
the velocity of the speed of light.  Let's call that one the 
"Einstein was partially all wet" hypothesis.

i am not going to touch that one because i am confident that 
a real scientist can offer a clear explanation of joe's 
smelly baby Zeno.  But, file it away anyway for the 
classroom yak box.

<hr>

                    Notes for the above.

Not so very 'Big Bang' like events may occur from time to 
time throughout the cosmos if:

Extreme dilated time conditions actually exists and

TIME is caused to stop because of

Escape velocities reaching the speed of light (c) and

Dilation is caused to decrease due to ever lessening gravity 
due to the

Existence of zero gravity port evaporation. 

<hr>


Now... a gazillion gazillion protons would/could then take 
up a LOT less space because of the lack of field 'energies' 
that then are currently generated.  Anyhow, an unimaginable 
compaction could be construed to exist for mass under 
extreme time dilation with all fields reduced to essentially 
zero.---

Restated:  Now, consider the 'binary black hole' accreting 
mass for billions of years.  As the mass enters the event 
horizon TIME stops for the accreted mass rendering it almost 
infinitely compactable because all the fields have ceased.  

The mass no longer contains any operative 'repulsive' or 
'gravitational' fields and therefore and almost infinite 
number of protons, neutrons, electrons, particles, can be 
built up, layer upon layer upon layer to incredible 
densities.
