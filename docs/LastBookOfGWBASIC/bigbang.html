<pre>Abstract:
Does TIME exist within a hot singularity?
Or is TIME external to the primal hot singularity?
Or is TIME both within and without the hot singularity?
Or is TIME totally non-existent within and without the singularity 
prior to any bang?  (sort of the same questin as #1)

             <b>Time within the singularity</b>

I am told that TIME dilates when it is around gravitational 
objects, but my old pocket watch didn't seem to pick up any 
measureable differences even though, while i was staring at 
the second hand, it did seem to skip a beat or two, but it 
has been doing that ever since it fell into the tub some 
decades ago.

But aside from that discrepancy, let's go back to point=0 & 
TIME=0 just before the big bang banged.

Now let's stick our head into the pre-banged big bang and 
see if we can hear any tick-tocking going on...

No?  too much dilation?  wait!  i hear tick-tocking...
seems like time is going on...  or something...
except that outside the pre-bang big bang it seems that time 
inside has stopped!  What on earth is going on?

Now... as the bang banged we can assume created densities 
immediately created to assume a mass whose escape velocity 
was in excess of the speed of light.  Time is still stopped 
inside the now banging big bang because the escape velocity 
is still too high.  When will it be enough to start the 
clock?

As the near instantaneous expansion of the universe 
continued, that is, as the bang, banged, an ever increasing 
diameter of universe became available, and densities became 
less and less.  But... Time still didn't exist outside the 
edges of the ever growing sphere of the newly born cosmos 
according to the big banger big bangers.

Now, at what point did the gravitationally caused escape 
velocity of the expanding albeit, contained cosmos, cease to 
exceed c?  You don't really expect a joe sixpack to have an 
answer to that question do you?

In other words, when did it become visible?  Because before 
and unless it becomes visible, time inside is dilated out to 
a stopping point outside and that being the case, time is, 
under those conditions, nonexistent inside for those looking 
in (as if they could) on the inside.  Physicists come up 
with the weirdest ideas...

So... we have an ever expanding cosmos of near infinite 
density holding back the starting time of TIME in the inside 
of what is being created as viewed from a non-existent 
outside...   sigh...

That means that unconstrained TIME inside only starts up to 
be visible or exists within a properly gravitational 
environment whose escape velocity is less than the speed of 
light.

So... again... what was the diameter and the age of the 
cosmos when TIME was allowed to start ticking?

         <b>TIME existing outside the big bang</b>

If TIME exists outside the big bang (it can't according to 
present concepts) then the dilation rates of TIME occur only 
as the universe expands or expanded, overriding the dynamic 
boundary areas of TIME as it does so with time still stopped 
in the inside of that mass, still "congealed" in black hole 
status.   i don't know... this is turning into a real puddle 
of crap...  

An existent TIME, which is really non-existent, outside the 
boundary areas of the big bang, would therefore NOT have a 
starting point or starting time.

Under those conditions, the non-existing new space outside 
of an accelerating expanding universe would be timeless, as 
well as on the inside, in those areas that are overridden 
with gravitational black hole objects galore, and dilating 
pinpoints of area time centered on the ever accreting single 
or solitary ever growing masses approaching black hole 
status

i hear snap, crackle, and popping again.  it would be time 
for my pill, but where we are, or i am, at, TIME hasn't been 
here yet...

Jeez!  what a long wait for Christmas and the Easter bunny.

Did you walk to work or bring your lunch?

I don't care whose last supper it is, no I.D., no wine.


                        notes to add
Mankind:  God's creation? or organic nothingness?

The consciousness of the universe...
