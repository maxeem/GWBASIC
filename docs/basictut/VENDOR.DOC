Part 2:  Distribution Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Individuals who wish to distribute Cascoly Shareware to friends or 
associates may do so in accordance with the restrictions outlined in 
LICENSE.DOC. 

Limited Distribution License:
-----------------------------

As the exclusive copyright holder for ANTIC, ATC, GREEN, FENCE, TOWERS, 
WEBS, FICTIONARY, BORDER, CAPBUF, ECOMASTER, PEG, SUPER VGA PUZZLE, PALETTE 
PLEEZER, BIBLE TIMELINE, QUILT, UDECIDE, and CHRONOS, Cascoly Software 
authorizes distribution only in accordance with the following restrictions.  
Please refer to the additional information listed below which is specific to 
ASP and non-ASP Disk Vendors, Computer Clubs, and Disk-of-the-Month style 
distribution. 

Individual Cascoly Shareware programs are defined as containing all the 
material listed in the PACKING.LST text file.  If any files listed in the 
PACKING.LST text file, or the PACKING.LST file itself, are missing, then the 
package is not complete and distribution is forbidden.  

    o  A Cascoly Shareware package - including all related program files and 
       documentation files - CANNOT be modified in any way and must be 
       distributed as a complete package, without exception.  (Either the 
       ZIP or self extracting EXE file must be used.  This is the sole 
       exception for modification -- you can use an alternate archiving 
       program.)  The PACKING.LST text file contains a list of all files 
       that are part of the Cascoly Shareware package.  

    o  No price or other compensation may be charged for a Cascoly Shareware 
       package.  A distribution cost may be charged for the cost of the 
       diskette, shipping and handling, as long as the total (per disk) does 
       not exceed US$8.00 in the U.S. and Canada, or US$12.00 
       internationally. 

    o  The Cascoly Shareware package CANNOT be sold as part of some other 
       inclusive package.  Nor can it be included in any commercial software 
       packaging offer, without a written agreement from Cascoly Software.  
       For information on combining the Cascoly Shareware package with 
       related programs to form a "disk-set", please refer to the 
       information below for ASP or non-ASP Disk Vendors. 

    o  Cascoly Shareware cannot be "rented" or "leased" to others. 

    o  The person receiving a copy of a Cascoly Shareware package MUST be 
       made aware that each disk or copy is ONLY for evaluation, and that 
       Cascoly Software has not received any royalties or payment for the 
       product.  This requirement can be met by including the complete 
       Cascoly Shareware package, which contains appropriate registration 
       reminders. 

    o  The person receiving a copy of Cascoly Shareware MUST be made aware 
       that he or she does not become a registered user until Cascoly 
       Software has received payment for registration of the software.  This 
       requirement can be met by including the complete Cascoly Shareware 
       package, which contains any appropriate registration reminders. 

    o  Licensee shall not use, copy, rent, lease, sell, modify, decompile, 
       disassemble, otherwise reverse engineer, or transfer the licensed 
       program except as provided in this agreement.  Any such unauthorized 
       use shall result in immediate and automatic termination of this 
       license. 

    o  U.S. Government Information:  Use, duplication, or disclosure by the 
       U.S. Government of the computer software and documentation in this 
       package shall be subject to the restricted rights applicable to 
       commercial computer software as set forth in subdivision (b)(3)(ii) 
       of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause at 
       252.227-7013 (DFARS 52.227-7013).  The Contractor/manufacturer is 
       Cascoly Software, 4528 36th NE, Seattle, WA 98105.
      
    o  Rack Vendors & CD-ROMs, please note additional restrictions below.

All rights not expressly granted here are reserved to Cascoly Software.

The following additional information and restrictions are intended for 
Shareware Distributors, Disk Vendors, and Computer Clubs who wish to 
distribute Cascoly Shareware. 
                  
ASP Associate (Disk Vendor) Member Information: 
-----------------------------------------------

Vendors who are ASP Associate Members in good standing are hereby given 
permission to distribute Cascoly Shareware in accordance with the 
Distribution Restrictions listed above.  ASP Associate Members (often called 
"ASP Approved Vendors") in good standing do not need to request permission 
to distribute this package.  ASP vendors who use rack vending or who wish 
to publish our programs as part of a CD-ROM, please note the further 
restrictions outlined below. 

This permission is in effect until or unless we notify you otherwise, in 
writing. 

ASP Vendor Members - Disk Sets:
-------------------------------
ASP Vendor Members who wish to distribute Cascoly Shareware as part of a 
collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set) may do so provided that all the 
other restrictions are met.  

Other (Non-ASP) Disk Vendor Information:
----------------------------------------
Shareware Distributors and Disk Vendors who are not ASP Associate Members, 
but who wish to distribute Cascoly Shareware need to comply with the 
following additional restrictions. 

In order for us to ensure that only current versions are distributed, we 
require that you send us a letter requesting permission to distribute any of 
our products.  

You may not list any of our products in advertisements, catalogs, or other 
literature which describes our products as "FREE SOFTWARE".  Shareware is 
"Try-Before-You-Buy" software, it is not free. Please include in your 
letter, a copy of your catalog.  If you are a new vendor, and no catalog is 
available, we need your written assurance that the ASP guidelines for 
vendors are being met -- ie, your catalog must emphasize that users must 
register and pay for shareware they receive from you. 

ASP vendor and BBS members automatically receive upgrades of Cascoly 
Shareware through the ASP group mailings.  Others can receive a complete set 
of current programs at a cost of $15 for shipping and handling.  (If you 
send six 3«" disks and a self addressed, stamped mailer, we waive the 
shipping charge).  This package contains distributable versions of the 
programs, plus descriptive information useful for catalogs and other 
advertising.    

Other (Non-ASP) Vendors - Disk Sets: 
------------------------------------
Vendors (non-ASP Vendor Members) who wish to distribute any Cascoly 
Shareware as part of a collection (such as PsL's MegaDisk set) must obtain 
written permission from Cascoly Software prior to beginning such a 
distribution.   

Computer Clubs and User Groups :
------------------------------
Computer Clubs and User Groups wishing to add Cascoly Shareware packages to 
their disk library may do so in accordance with the Distribution 
Restrictions listed above. 

Disk-of-the-Month (or Subscription) Distribution:
-------------------------------------------------
If you would like to distribute Cascoly Shareware as a Disk-of-the-Month, or 
as part of a subscription or monthly service, then the following 
restrictions apply: 

ASP Associate (Disk Vendor) Members in good standing are hereby given 
permission to distribute Cascoly Shareware under the Disk-of-the-Month style 
of distribution. 

Others (non-ASP Members) must contact us in advance to ensure that you have 
the most current version of the software. 

You cannot use a Disk-of-the-Month distribution to use up your inventory of 
old (out of date) disks.  Only current versions may be shipped as Disk-of-
the-Month disks.  



****** Attention All RACK VENDORS & CD-ROM publishers *******
------------------------------------------------------------------

It has come to our attention that shareware racks may be hurting Cascoly 
Software sales because shareware racks may compete with the low-priced 
retail racks on which our products are sold, and which pay us a royalty. 
Obviously this creates a problem for us.  So starting today (21 Aug 1992), I 
must prohibit all Cascoly, including both current games and our forthcoming 
titles, from being sold on shareware racks of any kind.  Please understand 
that this step is taken purely to protect royalties we are earning.  It 
boils down to the fact that our royalties are much greater than sales we see 
from shareware sold on racks. 

This affects rack sales of shareware only, not catalog sales, shareware sold 
at computer swap meets, BBS distribution, etc.  We are pleased when any 
vendor carries our shareware in catalogs, or sells disks containing Cascoly 
products in any way other than rack sales in retail locations. 

CD-ROM distribution:
-----------------------------
If you wish to add any of our programs to a CD-ROM or other collection, you 
will need written permission from Cascoly Software.  Such permission will 
also require a royalty to be paid to Cascoly Software.  (Either a one time 
fee, or a per-disk royalty is acceptable).


Please Help Us Serve You Better:
--------------------------------

We would appreciate copies of anything you print regarding Cascoly 
Shareware.  Please send us a copy of any reviews, articles, catalog 
descriptions, or other information you print or distribute regarding Cascoly 
Shareware.  Thank you for your time and assistance and for supporting the 
shareware marketing concept.
