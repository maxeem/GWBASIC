Shareware is a means of distributing software.  Under the shareware concept, 
software may be freely copied and passed along to others, or distributed 
through bulletin board systems or national networks. As a recipient of a 
shareware program, you may use the software for a short trial period to 
determine if it meets your needs.  If the software is not suitable, then you 
can discard it. If you decide to use it, you must pay by registering.  When 
you register a Cascoly shareware program, you receive: 
      * A copy of the latest version of the program
      * A bonus of any other Cascoly program of equal or lesser value
      * A free introductory account on CompuServe including a private User

        telephone.  Support by mail is also available, if accompanied
        by a SASE.
      * With some programs, you will also receive bonus maps, datasets
        or puzzles.

PALETTE PLEEZER

around the world in SuperVGA color!  But somehow, the palette has become 
jumbled and it's up to you to restore the image to its original beauty. How 
many times do you need to look at the original?  Start with 10 colors and 
work up to 99.  Great memory tester. 

Hall of fame for your best scores.  Save partly completed games, simple

*************************************************************************** 

GREEN, FENCE and TOWERS use the unique Cascoly 3-D perspective graphics 
system that shows fantastic detail (characters actually move behind walls or 
through water).  You're not limited to 2 directions for scrolling -- you can 
scroll in EIGHT directions.  Also, as you scroll from side to side, the 
perspective changes.  

In GREEN you help Planters to prevent the pavers from turning farms into 
parking lots. Pavers include mall developers, real estate agents, clear-cut 
loggers and other exploiters. There are several different maps, of varying 
difficulty. You have the ability to plant hedges, add walls, and to destroy 
pavement.  GREEN is a strategy game, similar in concept to Populous and 
SimCity.   

FENCE is a Tetris-like strategy game in which you build fences and mazes to 
prevent your sheep from escaping. You can change the landscape by planting 
hedges or stonewalls and by destroying unneeded fences. There are several 
maps, of varying difficulty. 

                                                     
How high can you build?  TOWERS is similar to Tetris, since you need to 
place blocks of varying size.  That's where the similarity ends -- you need 
logic and planning, rather than quick reflexes in TOWERS.  You build one 
level of the tower at a time, trying to fit the blocks in the tightest 
pattern.  Each level becomes the base for the next level.  

ANTIC -- AntiC is a cross between Othello and Life.  The object is to change 
all the squares in the pattern to the same color using the fewest number of 
transformations.  Anti-Chaos networks are formed from squares connected to 
each other by directional lines.   Each square is one of 3 colors and sends 
its color to the following squares in the network.  If only one color comes 
into a square, it takes that color.  If two colors come in, they cancel and 
the square assumes the third color. Each time you change a square, all the 
colors are recalculated and redrawn.  Ages 8 and up.  Mouse/ EGA 

WEBS is a deceptively simple solitaire game requiring both strategy and 
cunning.  You claim nodes on a web while trying to limit the nodes claimed 
to your computer opponent. Automatic display of potential moves, a variety 
of webs and difficulties give hours of challenge.  NEW IN V1.1: Web maker 
feature included.  Registered users are eligible to enter a cash prize 
contest. Ages 8 and up.  Requires mouse/EGA.  

PEG: No one really knows when PEG solitaire was invented. Some stories trace 
it to prisoners during the French Revolution, but published descriptions 
date at least 100 years earlier.  Most likely the game is even older.  PEG 
presents variations on the classic peg solitaire with multiple starting 
positions, and varying endgames.  One of the pleasures of playing the game 
on your computer is that you can quickly set up the board to try different 
strategies. Ages 8 to 88.  Requires mouse/EGA.  

ATC -- An air traffic controller game that's perfect for a few minutes or 
hours of fun.  Easy to learn, but difficult to master.  The game tracks best 
scores at each of 20 levels of difficulty.  Ages 10 and up.  (Supports 
monochrome or color)      

EGA ECOMASTER -- A diverting ecology game in which you bid for and trade 
animals based on their abilities to thrive in different environments.   No 
previous biological experience is assumed.  Intriguing graphics of all the 
animals, plus photographic images from around the world.  For 1 or more 
players.  For ages 10 and up.    Requires EGA and mouse.  

FICTIONARY <tm> -- The game of fantastic and farfetched definitions.  Each 
round one player chooses a word that no other player knows.  You can choose 
your own word or pick one from the large selection included with the game.  
Then each other player makes up their own definition for the word.  Everyone 
votes for what they think is the correct definition. Points are scored for 
guessing the proper one, or misleading other players.  Special rules allow 
play by 2 or even 1 player.    Ages 12 and up.  

QUILT is a diverting graphics program or nonresident screen saver, using 
half square quilting patterns.  You can create specific patterns or set the 
program on sequential mode for continuously changing patterns.  Change 
widths, patterns, rotate or flip the designs, or colors for "billions and 
billions" of combinations.  Full EGA and VGA support, with configurable 
color palettes chosen from 64 possible colors.   EGA/VGA req.  Ages 8 to 88.   

CAPBUF is a memory resident (TSR) program that lets you capture any text 
screen and save it for later processing or printing.  It is quite useful for 
programs that do not otherwise provide means of printing their results.  Use 
it for intermediate results of games, or collecting copies of messages while 
on a bulletin board.     (mono or graphics)  

UDECIDE helps you make decisions such as which software or hardware to 
purchase; ratings surveys; which project to pursue; ranking; or selecting 
colleges, movies, stocks, or wines.  You enter a list of elements by which 
you will evaluate the contenders, optionally giving each a weight.  Then you 
enter the possible options, and assign a value to each element.  You can 
then sort to obtain an ordered list of the best options.  Or you can perform 
what-if analyses by changing elements or weights.       (mono or graphics)  

CHRONOS
How old was Paul Revere when he rode into history?  How many years separated 
Michelangelo and Cortez?  With CHRONOS, you sort and select by individual 
people and events, or nations and occupations, to develop new insights and 
trace patterns across different eras and cultures.  You can modify or expand 
any of the datasets.  CHRONOS is used by history and art students, teachers, 
genealogists, writers and others interested in exploring historical 
relations or cultural events. CHRONOS includes a special gamemaker function 
and which randomly creates and presents questions of various kinds from 
datasets (for 1 or more players) 

CHRONOS comes with several datasets, which you can modify. Or you can design 
your own.  Registered users will receive the current program along with 
additional datasets, such as the BIBLE series, WW2(Pacific) and 20th 
century.    (mono or graphics)  

BIBLE-TIMELINE
A special version of CHRONOS, this program covers the period -2000 BC 
through the first centuries of the Christian Church.  The emphasis is on 
tracking the books of the Bible, but additional historical and cultural 
information is included for comparison.  The shareware version contains 
BIBLE-1 datasets: GENESIS, KINGS, and ROME. 

Registered users receive the BIBLE-2 covering BABYLON, GREECE and EXODUS, 
and other CHRONOS datasets, too.
