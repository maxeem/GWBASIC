<P>
       Reserved  words are those which are important to BASIC.
       They are <I>reserved</I> for  BASIC's  exclusive  use.    This
       means  you cannot have a variable name that is the same
       as any word on this list.  Reserved words  include  all
       commands,  statements,  and  functions in BASIC, plus a
       few words such as AND which perform special operations.
</P><P>
       An attempt to use a reserved word as  a  variable  name
       will  usually result in a SYNTAX ERROR.  These kinds of
       errors are sometimes hard to see because nothing  about
       the statement will <I>look</I> wrong.
</P><P>
       Correct  variable  names  may  include a reserved word.
       For example, while END may not be used  as  a  variable
       name,  ENDING  would be perfectly fine.  Likewise, NAME
       is reserved.  NAMES is not.
