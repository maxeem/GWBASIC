"The Game of GAMBLER!"                   (from Vol. 1 No. 8)                                                            GAMBLER! is more than a dozen different games of chance. Youand as many as three of your friends compete in a contest tosee who can parlay  a  $100  stake  into  $1000  first.  Thecomputer  would  not be content to just keep score and watchall this money change hands so it becomes  a  "player"  withjust the same chances of winning and losing as you have!                                                                On each player's turn,  he is first given the opportunity tobuy as many as  three  lottery  tickets.  A  lottery  ticketcosts  $10,  but  may return $100 to the owner if it matchesthe winning numbers in the lottery held occasionally.  Afterpurchasing any tickets desired,  the  wheel  of  fortune  isshown.  A  graphic  pointer dances randomly around the boardstopping momentarily beside the name  of  one  of  the  manygames  which  can be played.  The player touches any key andthe pointer slowly settles into one category -- that is  thegame which the player will participate in on his turn.                                                                  There  are  many  types of games available in GAMBLER!  Someare very simple;  you may  be  instructed  by  a  mysteriousfortune  teller  to  give  or receive amounts of money to orfrom other players or the bank.  The names of some of  thesecategories  are somewhat deceptive so pay close attention asthe message crawls slowly across the screen.                                                                            There  are  also  several betting games involving dice.  Youcan win or lose money by betting on the outcome of two  dicerolls -- will the total be even,  will your roll be highest,or will it be the lucky number seven?  There is even a  formof "dice poker" with the best hand taking the pot.                                                                      The game of GAMBLER!  even has its own horse racing track sothat all the players can bet on the outcome and try  to  winthe  purse.  Lotteries  are also held once in a while to payoff the winning lottery  tickets.  Big  money  is  availablewhenever  a  sweepstakes  is  held.  The  correct bet on theoutcome of the roll of six dice can bring the  winner  $150,$200, $300, or even $450.                                                                                               GAMBLER!  is  loosely based on a board game with many extrasadded.  Because the computer always plays,  you can practicewith  it.  And  since  as many as four humans can play alongwith the computer, it makes a great game for parties or whenyou have a large crowd eager  to  play  with  the  computer.Overall,  the  program is fairly straightforward and easy touse.                                                                                                                    The Grandy will make all its own decisions and  even  "touchkeys"  as  directed  by  the program.  The only exception tothis is the note at the bottom of the  page  asking  you  to"TOUCH  ANY  KEY  TO  CONTINUE".  Usually,  this delay is toallow you to read some  instructions  or  make  a  decision.Even when it is the computer's turn, it will wait for you togive the signal to continue.                                                                                            The  winner  is  the first player to go over the $1000 mark.In case of a tie,  the game  continues  until  someone  getsahead.  Should you go broke,  the bank will advance you $100but will charge you with one IOU.  As soon as you are  able,you  must  pay  the  IOU  back  at  a  price of $110.  Thesetransactions will take place only on your turn.                                                                         Let's look at how the program  works.  Lines  1  through  60perform some initialization chores.  Lines 30 and 40 set thenumber  of players N.  Line 50 determines the player's namesand initializes  money  M(I),  number  of  IOUs  IO(I),  andlottery   tickets  L$(I).   If  desired,   instructions  aredisplayed after prompting in line 50.                                                                                   The  main  game  loop is found in lines 70 through 190.  Theloop using variable IP cycles through  each  player's  turn.Present  money  totals  are  displayed in line 80.  Problemsdealing with players who have  gone  broke  are  handled  inlines  90  through 120.  Lottery tickets are bought in lines130 through 150.  A game number is  selected  in  subroutine290,  and  line  180  transfers  control  to the appropriateroutine.                                                                                                                Subroutine 200 is called from the main loop to check  for  awinner.  The  highest  money total is found in line 200.  Ifthat value  is  greater  than  $1000,  then  the  winner  isnotified;  otherwise,  the  game  continues.  The  option ofplaying a new game is presented in lines 240 and 250.                                                                   The lottery subroutine  begins  in  line  260.  The  programselects  a  two-digit  lottery ticket that is different fromall other lottery tickets issued.  The results are displayedin line 280.                                                                                                            The game selection routine begins in line  290.  The  borderis  printed,  and  the names of the games are read from DATAstatements beginning at line  390.  Lines  320  through  350wait  for  players  to touch any key.

Subroutine  420  performs  some   graphics   initialization,setting up graphics variables D$(1) through D$(6), which arepictures of the six dice.
