"SHOW AND TELL -- A Memory Game"        (from Vol. 1 No. 10)                                                            "SHOW AND TELL" is a simple memory  game  for  one  or  moreplayers.  It is written in BASIC,  and should operate on anyTandy 1000 with 128K or more memory.                                                                                    To  install  the  program  on  your   Grandy,   follow   theinstructions  in  your  manual  to  load the BASIC language.Type the command AUTO and press ENTER to have  the  computerautomatically  provide  line  numbers  in  increments of 10.Type in each line of the program as  shown  in  the  listingwhich  follows.  After  typing  in  the  last  line  of  theprogram,  press CTRL and BREAK together to end the automaticline  numbering  mode.  Use  the  command  LIST and the HOLDbutton to double check your listing.  When you are satisfiedthat all is correct,  enter SAVE "SHOWTELL" to  save  it  ondisk.  Type  RUN  to  begin  the  game.  If  an error shouldoccur,  compare each line of your program with  the  listingand  correct any typographical errors which may have slippedthrough.                                                                                                                The  game  is  simple  and  contains  an  adequate  set   ofinstructions.  At  the  beginning  of the game,  a player isshown the  answers  to  nine  questions  for  five  seconds.During  that time,  try to memorize not only the answers butalso their position on the screen.  When  the  five  secondsare up,  the answers will disappear.  The nine correspondingquestions will appear one at a time;  as each is  presented,try  to  remember  where the correct answer was,  and answerwith  the  number  of  that  answer.   You  will  find  thatincorrect  answers  can  sometimes  lead  to some very funnysituations.  Keep at it until you  have  answered  all  ninequestions correctly.  After viewing your score,  let someoneelse have a try, or you can try to better your own score.                                                               Line  10  through  70  of  the  listing  contains   variableinitializations  and  present  game  instructions.  Line  80reads one of the four sets of questions and  answers  storedin the DATA statements at the end of the program.  Each dataset  consists  of  a string named T$ which contains a phrasecommon to all of the questions (such as "Where  do  you...","What do you...",  "Who is...",  and so on).  There are alsonine sets of questions and answers stored  in  arrays  Q$(X)and  A$(X).  All  of the questions are assumed to begin withthe phrase found in T$.  The  order  of  the  questions  andanswers  are  scrambled  in  line  90.  The  game  screen isconstructed and the answers are displayed in lines  100  and110.  Line  120  leaves  the  answers  on  screen  for  fiveseconds.  (If you would like a longer or  shorter  duration,change the "5" in line 120 IF X+5>TIMER etc.)                                                                           The  order in which the questions are presented is scrambledin line 140.  Lines 150 through 180 ask a questions and waitfor the player's number response.  The answer  is  displayedin lines 190 and 200;  if it is incorrect, lines 210 through240 are executed.  If the answer is correct,  lines 250  and260  are  executed.   When  all  nine  questions  have  beenanswered,  lines 270 through 320 present the final score andoffer the chance to play again.                                                                                         The  four  question  and answer data sets are found in lines360-380,  420-440,  480-500,  540-560.  If you would like toadd extra data sets, be sure to follow the convention of theDATA statements shown.  You must also change line 80 so thatthe  program  will  know  how many data sets there are.  Forexample, if you add two more data sets,  you must change theargument  of FNR(x) in line 80 from the current value of "4"to "6".                                                                                                                 Many other games of this type soon  grow  old,  because  youbecome  familiar  with  the answers to all of the questions.However,  in this game,  knowing the answers is only a smallpart  of the challenge.  You have to remember where they areon the screen -- and that changes every time  you  play.  Infact, you never know which data set will turn up.  The orderof  the  answers  on  the  screen is different each time youplay,  and the order in which the  questions  are  asked  isdifferent,  too.  I  would love to see some of your questionand answer data sets;  if you come up  with  an  interestingbunch  of  puzzles,  send  them  in  on paper or disk to ONETHOUSAND.
