"Trivia Master"                          (from Vol. 2 No. 5                                                             The word "trivia" traces its origins  to  the  Latin  phrasemeaning  "crossroads"  or  "a  place which is common to manypaths".  Through the years,  its  meaning  has  evolved  andchanged,  and today it means "insignificant", "trifling", or"commonplace".  Despite its rather boring definition, makersof the immensely popular board games  have  found  that  thefield of trivia is anything but insignificant.                                                                          With  the "Trivia Master" program shown in the BASIC listingat the end of this article, you too can play the trivia gameand let your Tandy 1000 computer handle all  of  the  boringdetails.  While  you concentrate on answering the questions,you can let the computer roll the dice, maintain the playingboard, time the answers, and keep score.                                                                                If you are not familiar with trivia games,  here is a  quickreview  of  the  rules.  Two  to six individuals or teams ofplayers move around a playing field which resembles a  wheelwith  six spokes.  Each division on the field represents oneof six categories.  Each player must land on and  answer  atleast  one  question  from  each  of  the  six categories oftrivia.  The first player to complete all six categories andto answer one final selected by his or  her  opponents  winsthe game.                                                                                                               If  you have one of the many versions of trivia board games,you can use the questions  supplied  with  those  games.  Ifnot, you can still enjoy "Trivia Master".  Simply go to yourlocal  bookstore  (or  even  the  corner  grocery store) andpurchase a book of trivia questions and answers.  If you arewilling to spend a little more money, you can buy one of theauxiliary question sets provided by the  publishers  of  thecomplete game sets.  As a result, for just a few dollars anda  few minutes (spent typing in this program),  you can joinin the trivia game craze.                                                                                               To play the game,  simply  type  in  the  program  shown  inListing  1.  The  program  should  run  on  any  Tandy  1000equipped with 128K of RAM.  It features  bright  colors  andsimple sound effects.                                                                                                   When  you are ready to play the game,  locate your source of"trivial" questions and answers,  load BASIC,  and  RUN  theprogram.  You  will  be greeted with a title page containingsome introductory comments.  After a few moments of  programinitialization, you will be asked a few questions.  You mustfirst  indicate  how  many players (or teams of players) arecompeting.  Signal your response by pressing one of the keystwo through six.                                                                                                        Each of the players must enter his or  her  name.  If  teamsare  playing,  enter  the members' initials or just the teamcaptain's name.                                                                                                         After all of the players have signed in,  you must  enter  adescription  for  each  of  the  six  categories  of trivia.Following the prompts of the program,  enter a short  phrasefor each,  such as "TV",  "Sports", "Music", "History", etc.If you are using a set of cards  from  a  board  game,  thenenter  descriptions  that  match  those  groups.  If you areusing a book,  then enter "Chapter 1",  "Chapter 2",  and soon.  If  the  book does not contain chapters,  then pick sixpage numbers at random and mark them with a paper clip.                                                                 Once all of those preliminaries are out of the way, the gamecan begin.  This program does not  actually  show  a  visualrepresentation of the playing board; instead, it momentarilydisplays  the  titles  of all six possible categories (alongwith "ROLL AGAIN",  another possibility).  Your position  onplaying  board  is  remembered  by  the  program internally.While you study the board,  the computer automatically rollsthe  dice,  and calculates the final positions correspondingto each of your possible moves.  It then displays all of thecategories that  you  are  eligible  to  select.  Titles  ofcategories  that  you  cannot possibly reach on that roll ofthe dice are removed  from  the  screen.  No  more  countingsquares,  forgetting  how  many  moves  you have taken,  andarguing about which square you started from.                                                                            The arrows on the right-hand side of the screen  (under  the"YOU  NEED"  heading) point to the categories which you needto complete (the  categories  in  which  you  have  not  yetanswered a question correctly).  Thus, when the program asksyou  to  press the number of the category you have selected,choose one of the categories marked with an arrow (or  "ROLLAGAIN" if it is still present and you don't like any one theremaining  choices).  If  none  of  your  needed  categoriesremain, just select one that you feel you have a good chanceof answering correctly; you control the board as long as youcontinue to answer questions correctly.                                                                                 Once you have selected a category, the program will instructyour opponents to ask you a question from that subject area.Read the question,  then press any key to start  the  clock.The clock will audibly tick,  and buzz when it reaches zero.The group as a whole must decide whether or not  the  answercomes  before  the  buzzer.  At any time before or after thebuzzer,  you must press "R" or "W" to  signal  whether  youranswer  was  "right"  or  "wrong".  To  make  sure that youranswer was properly recorded,  the program will ask  you  toverify it.                                                                                                              Play  continues  as  each  participant attempts to answer atleast one question from all six categories.  Once  you  haveanswered a question from all six categories, you can win thegame  by returning to the starting position at the center ofthe game board  AND  answering  a  question  in  a  categoryselected  by  your opponents.  (Of course,  you can't reallytell where the center of the board is in this program -- butrest assured,  the computer will always move you toward thatcenter position.) If you miss that question,  you must leavethe center position and return on a later turn  for  anothertry.                                                                                                                    And  now for a couple of programming notes ...  if you wouldlike to change the amount of time on  the  countdown  clock,change the value of TT established in line 150.  The currentvalue  of TT=60 starts the clock at sixty seconds.  Those ofyou who read my  "Down  to  BASIC"  column  regularly  mightrecognize  the  subroutine found in lines 1300 through 1320.That is the subroutine originally presented in the December,1986,  issue of ONE THOUSAND.  It is  used  to  present  thewinner's  congratulatory  message  in  large  two-inch  highletters.                                                                                                                "Trivia Master" is great fun for two to six players.  I  canguarantee  that  the program has been "play-tested" for manylong, frustrating hours.  I enjoy communicating with readersof ONE THOUSAND.
