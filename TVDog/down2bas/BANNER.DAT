"Making Those BIG Signs"                 (from Vol. 2 No. 3)                                                            When you think of the home computer industry,  you  probablythink  of the major companies that have participated in thayrevolution ...  like Tandy, Apple,  IBM,  Microsoft,  Lotus,Epson,  Thursak  Publishing,  and  so  on.  And you can restassured -- all of those companies made  a  bundle  of  moneysupplying  us  with computer-related equipment and products.But that does not mean that the only entities  making  moneyare  those  faceless multi-million dollar corporations.  Oneof the most exciting aspects of the microcomputer  world  isthat  anyone -- from the largest corporation to the smallestone-man operation -- can make money!                                                                                    Just recently,  I saw  a  short  article  in  BUSINESS  WEEKmagazine.  For about $15, a small company in California willuse  their computer to print any message you select in large8-inch-high letters  banner-style  on  colored  paper.  Theywill   also   mail  the  resulting  message  to  anyone  youdesignate.  They probably print and  send  out  hundreds  of"Happy Birthday", "Happy Anniversary", and "Congratulations"banners  every  week.   What  a  marvelous  example  of  theentrepreneurial spirit!  And what a simple business  to  getinto.  All  you  need  is  a  small  office,  a computer,  aprinter,  and most importantly,  a program that provides thenecessary printer instructions.                                                                                         If  you  keep  your  eyes  open,  you will probably begin tonotice  computer-generated  banners  almost  everywhere  youlook.  You  know  what I mean -- signs or messages obviouslyprinted in page-size letters with the aid of a computer  anda  dot-matrix  printer.  You  see  them everywhere now -- inshopping malls, restaurants, schools, conventions, meetings,and in general, any place a high-visibility and eye-catchingmessage needs to be displayed.                                                                                          Many of those signs we see were generated on home  computersjust  like  ours  with the help of banner-printing programs;and most of those users were forced to spend $10, $25,  $50,or  more to purchase a program written specifically for thatpurpose.  (Not only that,  but many require special printersmore  sophisticated  and  graphics-oriented than the ones wetypically use at home.) As I thought about  the  problem,  Ibegan  to  appreciate  the  price they charged:  in order toprint those large eight-inch high letters,  some  programmerhad  to  do  some  very tedious work in deciding what imagesshould be printed for each and  every  letter,  number,  andpunctuation  mark found on the computer's keyboard.  I couldenvision lines and lines of complicated DATA  and/or  LPRINTstatements.                                                                                                             But one day, I had a flash of insight.  I realized there wasa   very  simple  way  to  have  the  computer  provide  theinformation necessary to print large page-size letters,  andit  was  right  under  my  nose!  One extra advantage to thetechnique I found was that it would work on ANY  printer  --and  that means anything from thermal printers to simple dotmatrix  printers  to  daisy   wheel   printers   to   ultra-sophisticated laser printers and everything in between.  Trythis  little  exercise  on your own computer.  Start up yourGrandy computer, enter BASIC,  and once you receive the "Ok"message,  enter  the command SCREEN 1 and press ENTER.  Thiscommand will force the computer to switch from  the  defaultscreen  mode (80 characters per line) to a higher resolutiongraphic mode of display.  In this mode,  it is  possible  toSET  or  RESET  each  of  64,000  pixels  (or  "dots" on thecomputer's  screen);   the   screen   is   320   dots   widehorizontally,  and  200 dots high in the vertical direction.When you display text,  there is room for 40  characters  oneach line, and each letter is no more than 8 pixels wide and8 pixels high.                                                                                                          Put  your  nose  up  against  the  screen and study the "Ok"message displayed in this  mode.  Even  though  we  tend  tothink  of  the  letters  formed  on  the  screen  as smooth,continuous lines,  it is  obvious  that  they  are  actuallyconstructed from the 8 x 8 matrix of pixels.  Each letter isconstructed by "lighting up" or "turning off" each of the 64pixels  in that screen position's checkerboard-style matrix.Aha!   Are  you  beginning  to  see  how  we  can  use  thisinformation to print large versions of the letters?  Perhapsyou are already way ahead of me, but permit me to explain.                                                              Your  BASIC  manual  explains  that the POINT command can beused to see whether any pixel on a graphics-mode  screen  is"turned  on" or "turned off".  If we first place a characteron interest on the screen using the PRINT  command,  we  canthen use the POINT command to check on the status of each ofthe  64 pixels used to form that character.  We can then usethat information to print larger-than-life characters on ourprinters (and that applies to both dot  matrix  printers  aswell as daisy wheel printers).  Instead of "lighting up" and"turning  off" pixels on the video screen,  we can print X'sor empty spaces to create the images on paper.                                                                          The program shown at the end of this column does just  that.(Obviously,  to use this program, you must own a printer.  Ihope that does not leave out too many of my readers.) It canbe just about any kind of printer that prints  in  80-columnformat.  You should use continuous paper -- it can be eitherroll paper (like that used with a teletype),  or the kind ofpaper folded and perforated at the end of each page.                                                                    RUN the program and give it a try.  Enter any  message  thatyou  would  like printed in banner style after the prompt onthe first screen.  Check to see that your printer  is  readyto  go,  following  the  check  list presented on the secondscreen.  Watch in amazement as your  banner  is  printed  inlarge  eight  inch  high letters.  After the first banner isprinted,  the program offers you the  opportunity  to  printanother banner.                                                                                                         How  does  it  work?  Line 140 sets the screen in the mediumresolution  mode  #1.  Lines  150  through  250  present  anintroductory  message.  Line  260  is  used  to  accept  themessage to be printed,  which is stored in  string  variableM$.  Notice  that  the  LINE INPUT command is used;  this isnecessary since the user's message  often  contains  commas,quotation  marks,  and colons which would confuse the simpleINPUT statement.                                                                                                        Lines 300 through  430  construct  a  simple  drawing  of  acomputer  printer  (well,  at  least  it  is a picture of MYprinter).  Lines 440 through 480  serve  as  a  reminder  toeliminate   a  few  of  the  more  common  problems  usuallyencountered with a printer -- Is the printer  power  on?  Isthe  paper  positioned  correctly?  Is  the printer on line?Lines 490 and 500 wait for a signal  from  the  user  beforecontinuing.  The  POKE  statement  of  line  500  clears thekeyboard buffer of all extraneous keystrokes and then  waitsfor a "new" keystroke to satisfy the INPUT$(1) command.                                                                 Lines  540  through  580  place  a  "WORKING" message in thecenter of the screen,  just to reassure the user that thingsare  going  OK.  Lines  590 through 610 place each letter ofthe message to be printed (one letter  at  a  time)  in  theupper  left  corner  of  the  screen.  Line  600 changes thebackground color periodically just to add some randomness tothe screen display.                                                                                                     Line 620 begins a FOR-NEXT loop using variable B to  examineeach  of  the  8  columns  of pixels making up the charactercurrently displayed on the screen.  Line 640  prints  a  fewspaces  to  leave  a  one-inch  margin  along the top of thebanner.  Line  650  begins  a  second  FOR-NEXT  loop  usingvariable  D  to  examine  each of the 8 pixels in the columnselected by variable B.  Line 690  examines  each  of  thosepixels  -- if the pixel is "on",  eight X's are printer.  Ifit is off,  eight spaces are printed.  At the  end  of  eachcolumn of pixels, the FOR-NEXT loops are incremented in line700.                                                                                                                    Once the banner is finished, lines 740 through 800 offer thechance  to  prepare another banner.  If the answer is "yes",the program begins again.  If not, the screen is restored toits original default mode (SCREEN 0).                                                                                   And now for a few customization tips ...  As it exists  now,the  program  prints about four large characters per printedpage.  If you would like to squeeze  more  characters  on  apage (that is,  make them thinner),  change line 630 so thatit reads FOR C=1 TO 1.  If you want to make the letters evenwider, change line 630 to FOR C=1 TO x,  where x is a numbergreater  than  2.  The  program  uses  an  "X" to create thecharacters on the printer.  If you would like to  substitutesome other character,  change the value of 88 in line 690 tothe ASCII value of the character  you  would  like  to  use.Solid  characters like ASCII values 176,  177,  178,  or 219might be interesting.  Remember, as you enter the message tobe printed,  you can enter any  of  the  graphic  charactersusing  the ALT key and the numeric keypad.  For example,  ifyou want to prepare a valentine for your loved one,  you canenter a heart by holding down the ALT key, pressing 3 on thenumeric  keypad  (3 is the ASCII value for the heart symbol)and then releasing the ALT  key.  You  have  access  to  theentire  set  of ASCII characters if you remember that trick.If you would like the program to return to the A> prompt  atthe end instead of returning to the BASIC Ok prompt,  changethe END statement in line 790 to SYSTEM.                                                                                As I mentioned earlier,  owners of other brands of computersmight  have  to  pay as much as $50 for a program like this.It is yours for an investment of about 30  minutes  of  yourtime.
