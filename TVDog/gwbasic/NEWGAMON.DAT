"A Computerized Backgammon Opponent"     (from Vol. 1 No. 7)                                                            NEWGAMON  is  a  computer  program  that  allows you to playbackgammon against a computerized opponent.  Though NEWGAMONcertainly will not win  any  tournaments,  it  is  an  aboveaverage  player -- good enough to provide plenty of practiceand to keep you on your toes.                                                                                           I downloaded the program from a computerized bulletin  boardservice  (BBS)  here in my home town.  In its original form,the program did not actually play the  game;  it  only  keptscore  while  two  human  players participated.  Imagaine mydisappointment when I found that out!  I was really  lookingforward to matching wits with the computer.                                                                             So,  to make a long story short, I added a new subroutine tothe program to  allow  the  computer  to  become  an  activeplayer.  If you already know how to play backgammon, you canskip to the last paragraph of this article.  If not, here isa quick primer on how to play backgammon.                                                                               Backgammon  is played on a board containing 24 "points".  Inthis game,  each of those points (or positions)  is  labeledwith  the letters A through X.  Each player controls fifteenplaying pieces or "pips".  In this game,  you  are  assignedthe  solid  green  pips,  while  the  computer  controls thespotted red pips.                                                                                                       Your fifteen pips are scattered  across  the  board  as  youstart the game -- 2 are on point X,  5 are on point M, 3 areon point H,  and 5 are on point F.  The computer's pips  areplaced in mirror opposite positions.  The object of the gameis to move all of your pips into your "home table" (for you,the region between points A through F; for the computer, theregion  between  points S through X) and then to move all ofyour pips off of the board before your opponent does.                                                                   Movement is accomplished on each player's  turn  by  rollingtwo  dice.  If  you roll a 3 and a 4,  then you can move onepip 3 spaces and another pip 4 spaces (or you could move thesame piece first 3 spaces,  then 4 spaces).  By the way,  ifyou roll doubles, you get twice as many moves.  For example,if  you roll two 3's,  you get to move 4 pips 3 spaces each.Movement proceeds in a "horseshoe" direction.  You move yourpips from X to M,  from M down to L,  and from L back to  A.The computer moves in the opposite direction (from A to X).                                                             You  can move your pips onto almost any point.  If the pointis empty,  then you can move onto it.  If some of your  pipsalready occupy a point,  you can move onto it.  If the pointcontains one and only one of your opponent's pips,  you  canmove  onto that point and "hit" your opponent's "blot" (moreon that later).  If the point contains two or more  of  youropponent's  pips,  you CANNOT move onto that point;  his two(or more) pips are effectively "blocking" that point.                                                                   If you do move onto a point and "hit" an  opponent's  singleunprotected  pip,  his  pip is moved "onto the bar".  When aplayer has a pip on the bar,  he cannot make any other movesuntil that pip is retrieved from the bar.  You must roll thedice  to  re-enter a pip from the bar;  for example,  if youroll a 4 and a 5,  then you could move a pip  from  the  baronto  the  fourth  or fifth point (labeled D or E).  If bothpoints are blocked,  then you are stuck and have to  forfeityour move!                                                                                                              Once  you  have  moved all of your pips into your home table(between A and E), you can begin to "bear off" your pips (orremove them from the board).  If you roll a 4 and a 5,  thenyou  can  move  one pip each from points D and E.  You don'thave to bear off; if you wish, you can use your roll to movepieces normally.  In case you cannot bear off a pip  becausea  point  is  empty,  then  you can move a pip from the nextlower point.  Remember,  if you should be "hit" and  lose  apip to the bar, then you cannot bear off any more pips untilyou  retrieve  that pip from the bar and move it back aroundto your "home table".  The player who first bears off all ofhis pips wins the game.                                                                                                 This implementation of backgammon makes it very easy to playthe game.  It is fully prompting,  with a  few  "beeps"  and"boops"  to  prompt  you for your moves.  While the computerthinks,  a subtle clicking sound lets you know something  isgoing  on.  If you find the noises offensive,  you can pressF1 to toggle the sound off and on.  The  computer  tries  toanticipate  your moves.  For example,  when you roll doublesor when you have already taken one of your  two  moves,  thecomputer  does not stop to ask you "how many points you wantto move" since the  answer  is  obvious.  In  other  obvioussituations,    the   computer   will   supply   the   answerautomatically.  The only non-obvious  situation  is  bearingoff;  when  you  wish  to bear off,  simply press ENTER whenprompted for HOW MANY?  That's all you need  to  know.  Goodluck and enjoy backgammon!
