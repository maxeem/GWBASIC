Condo.Doc -- Documentation for Condo.bas.
========================================

Condo originated as a game to be run in the meager memory (4k) of a
TRS-80 model I and has since evolved through a model III version,
a nongraphics model 4 version, a graphics model 4 version, a talking
model 4 version, and, finally, a Tandy 1000 version.  At each step,
I added some enhancements but left the game itself alone.  Condo is
an unrealistic real estate game.  I thought the idea was interesting,
and set out to write a quick, short game as an 'experiment' and liked
it so much (along with people I know) that it's evolved this far.

  Condo can be played by from 1-10 players and a number of turns.
Each player is color coded for easy recognition.  Each player starts
with a given amount of money ($20,000) and may purchase the condo
he is 'rolled'.
  Each condo is randomly picked from a list of 20 sites, each with
certain attributes.  Those sites are then randomly modified by a
system of percentages to make it more interesting.  The categories
are as follows:

Storm - only sales are decreased for one turn
Earthquake- structure engulfed
Tornado - part of structure destroyed
Flood - not many fish interested in rooms this time of year.

  These categories allow you to determine whether or not you wish to
purchase the property.
  Insurance is the next category, and costs $7,000.  It will give back
less, the same, or more than the cost of the condominium.  It is up
to you to determine if you need it or not, and when.
  Materials determine the durability of the structure.  Best quality
will give you the best chance of weathering an earthquake, tornado,
or storm.  Of course, the computer will only tell you about these
things if you are actually damaged by them.
  Inferior materials is a risky proposition, but sometimes an
unavoidable one in the early parts of the game.  They are cheap, but
increase your chances of floods, tornadoes and earthquakes.  Also,
the dreaded inspectors may decide your buildings need repairs or
to be demolished entirely.
  Money will be continually earned by condos throughout the game, so
the condo you buy on turn 1 will still be making money at turn 20.
Once a condominium survives the first turn, it survives the game.
  Everything else is self-explanatory.  Please feel free to contact me
about any bugs, improvements, or modifications you would like 
corrected or added.
