                             ROYAL FLUSH
                        SUMMARY OF THE PROGRAM
The program "ROYAL FLUSH" imitates a one dollar casino video poker
slot machine.  The program should operate on any IBM PC but does take
advantage of the Tandy 1000s SCREEN 6 capability. The program is easy
to run and only uses four keys, the left, right, down cursor, and
enter keys.  The program was written for GW-basic (version 2.02).
While in basic, load the program under the name "IBMROYAL" and run. 
Push the down cursor key to insert coins into the video poker slot
machine. As coins are inserted, the number of coins will be
highlighted on the coin table.  The maximum number of coins allowed is
five.  After the user has inserted the desired number of coins, hit
enter to deal the cards.  The cards are then created and dealt from
the right hand corner of the screen and placed along the lower half of
the screen.  To discard any of the cards not desired, use the left or
right cursor key to move the discard box over the desired card and hit
enter to leave the word "DISCARD" in the box.
If the user makes a mistake, he needs to move the discard box over the
discarded card and push enter again.  This will remove the word
"DISCARD" and the card will no longer be discarded on the next deal.
The user has the option to clear all "DISCARDS" by pushing the right
cursor key until the discard box is over the "CLEAR BOX" and push
enter. 
To deal new cards to replace the discarded cards, place the discard
box over the deal box and push enter.  The cards with the word
"DISCARD" will be changed automatically for new cards.
The program will then evaluate the cards to determine if the user has
a winning hand.  The type of hand will be highlighted on the coin
table. The program then informs the user of his winnings and also
keeps track of the total amount of winnings minus the money spent.
This is printed in the lower right corner of the screen. Of course if
the user has won, an alarm will go off just like in a casino.
The program will then clear all the cards and start the "INSERT COIN"
box blinking again.
To escape the program push the escape key and the program will exit to
DOS.
