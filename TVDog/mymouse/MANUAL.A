     Until now it couldn't be done.  You couldn't store

pictures from any mouse graphics program on the market and

then use them in your GW-BASIC programming.  But that was

then, and MYMOUSE is now.  MYMOUSE is a complete mouse

graphics program in GW-BASIC that uses the Tandy Color Mouse

to create and store pictures which you can then use in any GW-

BASIC program you wish to.  For a GW-BASIC programmer it's

like finding out that there is a Santa Claus.  Create graphics

pictures for the fun of it, and/or for use in your other

programs.  Use your printer to print out your graphics

pictures, and/or load them up in other programs - the

restrictions are off.

     MYMOUSE is a full-fledged piece of software with plenty

of instructions, so I'll stop "tooting my horn" and get down

to the business at hand.  While MYMOUSE was created on a Tandy

1000 SX, it will load and run on any computer which will load

and run GW-BASIC and offers Screen Mode 5.  This includes all

the Tandy 1000 series computers and higher with CGA (color

graphics adaptor), which is standard on the EX, HX, SX, TX,

SL, TL, etc.  Though created using GW-BASIC version 3.2,

MYMOUSE will run on GW-BASIC version 2.11 or higher and it is

recommended that your computer have 256K or more of memory.

There are no special requirements for the printer.  No control

codes, only the programs which come on the disk and are

automatically installed as the program runs.  MYMOUSE is a two

disk drive program, with the program disk going into drive A

and the portfolio disk going in drive B.  If you have a hard

drive you can modify this so both the program and portfolio

disks are on drive C (or whatever drive your hard disk

occupies), or you can put the program disk on drive C and the

portfolio disk in a floppy disk drive, as you wish.

     The wait is over.  It's time to get started at last.
