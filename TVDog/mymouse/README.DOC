MYMOUSE is set up to be a two disk drive program with the program disk in 
drive A and the portfolio disk in drive B.  To get started with MYMOUSE,
first make a self-bootable diskette (format/s).  Onto this diskette first 
copy these files from your dos disk:  Basic.exe and Graphics.com.

Now put the following programs on your self-bootable disk from the downloaded
MYMOUSE FILES (this will be your program diskette): Autoexec.bat, Bigfont.bas,
BookA.mmp, BookB.mmp, BookD.mmp, Digifont.bas, MMPicE.bas, MYMOUSE.bas, 
Prn4mat.bas, Safety.bas, R.bat, T.bat, TR.bat, and Zoom.bas.

Put these on a spare disk from the downloaded MYMOUSE FILES:  Altgraf1.mmp,
Altgraf2.mmp, Manual.A, Manual.B, Manual.C, Manual.D, Manual.E, Gc4mat-R.mmp,
Gc4mat-T.mmp, PrnRmode.mmp, PrnTmode.mmp.

First, print out the files Manual.A, Manual.B, Manual.C, Manual.D, and 
Manual.E.  After reading these you are ready to use MYMOUSE.

Enjoy.
