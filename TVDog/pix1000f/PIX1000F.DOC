 
                                   PIX 1000F


    Pix1000 is a graphic paint program for the Tandy 1000. It runs in the 320
  x 200, 16 color enhanced CGA mode that is only available on the Tandy 1000.

    Pix1000 was written in Tandy/GW basic on a Tandy 1000 EX personal
  computer. It should work on any of the Tandy 1000's running Tandy/GW basic.

  To run the program the following files must be in the same directory with
  BASIC.COM and BASICA.EXE;

     PIX.BAT               a batch file that loads basic and runs PIX1000
     PIX1000F.BAS          the basic program
     TITLE.CLP             title clip loaded when run
     COL.CLP               the color menu
     MEN.CLP               the tool bar
     FONT2.FNT             this font is loaded when run
     FONT3.FNT             extra font

  Type PIX and hit enter to start the program.


             ---------------  USING THE PROGRAM  -----------------

    When the program is started a title screen will appear while the program
  loads it's menus. When ready the screen will go black and the tool bar will
  appear across the top of the screen. It is now ready to go.

    The program is controlled with either the keyboard or a joystick (the
  self-centering kind works best). The program starts up in keyboard mode but
  can be switched anytime to joystick control by pressing "J", and back to
  keyboard by pressing "K". When in joystick mode you can switch between right
  or left joystick being active by pressing "R" for right or "L" for left,
  (left is the default).

    Program control is basically as follows.
