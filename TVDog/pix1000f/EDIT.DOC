                                     EDIT


    The edit is a short program I wrote to help me create the DRAW string
fonts used in Pix1000. Almost all available commands for it are on function
keys 1 through 5. The only command not available on a function key is the "S"
command. Typing Sx where x is a number (multiples of 4) will change the scale
of the display. The default scale is 32. When you issue the edit command you
are prompted for a character or key that you want to assign a DRAW string to.
Ascii codes 1-128 are available to assign DRAW strings to, (press ALT and type
the ascii code on the numeric keypad to assign codes 1-31). You do not have to
necessarily create a font file. You can assign any DRAW string to the keys,
electronic symbols, for example, anything you want.

    After you input what key you want to work on press <HOME> or the arrow
keys to move to the top left corner of the screen and start typing in the draw
string, Ux, Dx, Gx, M+x,+y, etc. (If you don't know how GW Basic's draw
command works then go to the library or buy Tandy's BASIC Reference Manual.)
Pressing <ENTER> will cause the program to display the string you are working
on in the reference grid in the lower half of the screen. You can then press
<HOME>, <END>, or the arrow keys to move back to the top of the screen and
continue editing your draw string. Pressing <ENTER> will redraw the string
with any updates. When finished the draw string press any of the other 5
functions keys to go on to something else. F1 edit, will repeat what was just
described. F2 display, clears the screen and lets you type in any characters
you have defined to see how the look in relation to one another. Press F5 exit
from here to return to the command mode. F3 load, loads any existing font
files so you can edit them. F4 save, saves the file to disk so that it can be
used with Pix1000. F5 exit, ends the program.
