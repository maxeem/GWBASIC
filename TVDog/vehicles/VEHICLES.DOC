         There are two BASIC programs that will let you see pictures
         of cars, trucks, and vans. One program draws pictures of
         motor vehicles made in 1970. One program draws pictures of
         motor vehicles made in 1925 and 1940. When you run either
         program, you will see a list of motor vehicles. Type a number
         next to the motor vehicle desired and type a number between 0
         and 15 except 7 and 11 for the color desired. The color
         numbers are:
         0 - Black                     1 - Blue
         2 - Green                     3 - Cyan
         4 - Red                       5 - Magenta
         6 - Brown                     7 - Light Gray
         8 - Dark Gray                 9 - Light Blue
         10 - Light Green              11 - Light Cyan
         12 - Light Red                13 - Light Magenta
         14 - Yellow                   15 - White
         I hope that you will enjoy the programs.
