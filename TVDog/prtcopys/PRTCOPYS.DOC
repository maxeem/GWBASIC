       This is the documentation file for "PRTCOPYS.BAS".
     
         DeskMate's "TEXT" application has no facilities for printing
     multiple copies of a text file, but it does have the capability of
     printing to a file.  
         PRTCOPYS.BAS is written in GW-BASIC and is very simple to use. 
     First, you must use "TEXT" to print the document to a file.  then run
     PRTCOPYS.BAS. When it is run, it will ask you for the name of the file
     to print (include disk drive, path, filename, and extension), and how
     many copies you want.  You will then be asked if the information is
     correct, answer by hitting <Y>es, <N>o, or <Esc>.  <Y> will start
     printing (be sure that the printer is on, and has enough paper).  <N>
     will ask you to reenter the information.  Hitting the <Esc> key exits
     the program.  It is much simpler to use than it is to explain.
     
         There are so many different system configurations, and so many
     different ways to set things up with DeskMate, that I can't include a
     complete list of setup instructions.  But I will explain how I have it
     set up on my system just to give a general idea.  
     
         I have created a program list box in DeskMate for the BASIC
     programs I use with DeskMate (PRTCOPYS.BAS is only one of them).  The
     list box is set to :
                         Menu Title: BASIC
                       Program Name: BASICA.COM
                Data File Extension: BAS
                 Start-up Directory: C:\DESK
                        Clock Speed: Fast
     and the list box size is set to the default.  I do not have BASICA.COM
     in the same directory as DeskMate (c:\desk), but it is in a
     directory that is stated in the DOS "PATH=" statement.  The BASIC
     program itself (in this case PRTCOPYS.BAS) IS in the same directory as
     DeskMate.
         I have it set up this way to make it as easy to run a BASIC
     program as it is to run a DeskMate application.  
     
         This program will work on ANY file you wish to print.  It will NOT
     change the format of the file it is printing.  If the DOS "TYPE" or
     "PRINT" commands will not print the file properly, then PRTCOPYS.BAS
     will not either.  When I use PRTCOPYS, first I print out the file
     using the DOS type command as such:
     
                     "TYPE thisfile.txt > prn"
     
     if that gives me an acceptable printout, then I will use PRTCOPYS to
     print as many more as I need.  If the printout is not acceptable, then
     I have to change the text file I want to print and try again.

     small programs to perform some trivial task (or even a not so trivial
     task) send them to me, and I'll take a crack at it.
