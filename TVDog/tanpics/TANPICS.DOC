                                    TANPICS
                  Some Doctor Who pictures for the Tandy 1000
                              by Andrew Rossmann

requirements:
  MS-DOS 2.1 or later
  At least 18K available memory
  Standard built-in video

   To view these pictures, just type TANPICS. This will start up a batch file 
that lets you view each picture.

   I originally found these pictures in simple CGA line drawing from a file 
called WHOPICS.ARC. I converted them to Tandy format, then to PC Paintbrush's 
PCX format. I used Pbrush to greatly enhance them. I then converted them back 
to Tandy format for general use. (Programs like OPTIKS and PCRGB do not 
properly understand the Tandy modes.)
   I wrote the program TANLOAD to display these pictures. After the picture 
is displayed, press any key to stop viewing it. When used in a batch file, it 
returns an ERRORLEVEL of:
    255 = Monochrome mode found (video mode 7)
    254 = No filename given
    253 = Unable to select Tandy video mode
    252 = Couldn't read the file
    251 = Not enough memory to run the program
    250 = File is NOT in BASIC's BSAVE format
    249 = File is NOT a graphic file (The segment is not &HB800)
    248 = File is NOT Tandy graphic (Probably a 16K CGA picture)
  247-1 = Couldn't open file, number is from DOS
      0 = No errors

Usage for TANLOAD: TANLOAD [/H] filename
        /H = use the High Resolution mode (640x200, 4 color)
  filename = The filename with any drive/path needed. The .TAN extension will 
             be added automatically.

   The program GETKEY simply returns whatever key you press as an ERRORLEVEL. 
Lower case is converted to Upper case.
