GRID.DOC is a three-dimensional tic-tac-toe program written to take advantage
of the TANDY-1000's graphics capability.  I did not code the logic of the 
program.  It came from an unknown source.  I only added in the routines to
change the output from ascii teletype to a 3-dimensional grid representation.

Specifing a particular cell in a grid is specified by a 3-digit sequence:

	1) The grid level 1-3 (1 being the top most)
	2) The row number 1-4 (1 being the farthest from screen)
	3) The column number (1 being the right-most)

For example:  234 would specify the second grid, third row, and 4th column.

The program will only accept digits and the <BACKSPACE> (for correcting a
previous keystroke).
