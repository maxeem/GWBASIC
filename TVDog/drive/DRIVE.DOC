         You will drive a car that is on the bottom of the screen. The
         cars that appear at the top of the screen are driven by drunk
         drivers who can't drive straight down the road. Your object
         is to steer your car around the other cars and not to crash
         into one of the cars. The insurance company is watching you.
         If you pass 100 cars without crashing, the insurance company
         will give you a 25% discount on your insurance coverage. If
         you crash into a car, the insurance company wi11 cancel your
         insurance coverage. When you run the program, you will be
         asked for the difficulty level. 2 is easiest and 20 is
         hardest. I hope you will enjoy my program.
