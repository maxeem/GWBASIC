THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED FOR USE WITH TANDY 1000EX OR SX AND THE DMP-130
PRINTER. I AM BY NO MEANS A DEVOUT PROGRAMER BUT, I FOUND THIS METHOD OF
SENDING PRINTER CODES PRETTY USEFUL EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE A LITTLE CRUDE.
WHAT I DID WAS TO MAKE ONE LINE BASIC PROGRAMS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL FONT
AND LETTER STYLE AND, THEN MAKE A SEPARATE BAT FILE FOR EACH. 
  
  TO CHANGE A CODE, THE PRINTER MUST BE IN THE "TANDY MODE" AS THE CODES
FOR THE IBM ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. NEXT, TO CHANGE A CODE, AS AN EXAMPLE,
IF YOU WANTED THE ITALICS STYLE, YOU WOULD TYPE "ITALICS <CR>". IF YOU 
WANTED BOLD YOU WOULD TYPE "BOLD <CR>" ECT. 

   I HAVE SINCE FOUND MEMORY RESIDENT PROGRAMS MUCH EASIER TO USE BUT,
SINCE I AM ONLY 4 MONTHS INTO COMPUTERS, I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUCH A BIG
ACCOMPLISHMENT, I JUST HAD TO SHARE IT WITH OTHERS EVEN IF IT ONLY HELPS
NEW USERS.
    YOU SHOULD PUT COMMAND.COM ON THE SAME DISC WITH THESE FILES AND 
BASIC.EXE OR AT LEAST A PATH TO BASIC.EXE. YOU CAN ALSO CREATE SIMULAR
PROGRAMS MIXING COMBINATIONS OF COMMANDS. IF YOU HAVE A COMPILER SUCH
AS "MICROSOFT'S C OR TURBO BASIC, THESE WILL REALLY WORK LIGHTNING FAST.

   IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS, I CAN BE REACHED VIA ELECTRONIC
