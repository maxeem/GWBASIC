         This drawing program lets you draw a picture in 16 colors and
         paint a picture in 256 colors. This program does not require
         a joystick or a mouse or a touch pad or a light pen. You
         select a drawing command by pressing a function key. The
         command asks you questions such as "X and Y coordinates" or
         "Drawing Color".  After you answer the questions, the command
         does its job.  Here are the limits for questions:
         X coordinates - 0 to 319
         Y coordinates - 0 to 191
         X radius - 0 to 319
         Y radius - 0 to 319
         Starting angle - 0 to 6.28 or -.001 to -6.28
         Ending angle - 0 to 6.28 or -.001 to -6.28
         Column - 1 to 40
         Row - 1 to 24
         Drawing color - 0 to 15
         Painting color - 0 to 15 or $0000 to $FFFF
         Border color - 0 to 15
         Some questions ask you "Are you sure (Y/N)?". Press "Y" if
         you want to go ahead or "N" if you change your mind. You can
         press the [ENTER] key at any question if you change your
         mind. You will need a Tandy 1000 computer with at least 256K
         RAM and a color monitor. The "Print Picture" command requires
         the "GRAPHICS.COM" file which comes with the computer. To
         install the "GRAPHICS.COM" file, if you are in BASIC, type
         "SYSTEM" at "OK" prompt and when you are at DOS prompt, type
         "GRAPHICS" and answer the questions about which printer you
         have. Here are how the drawing commands work.
          
         F1 - Free Draw - Lets you draw details such as door handles
         for cars. You are asked for the X and Y coordinates of the
         starting point and the drawing color. Here are how the keys
         work:
         ENTER - returns you to the drawing command prompt.
         Q or 7 - draws up and left.
         W or 8 - draws up.
         E or 9 - draws up and right.
         D or 6 - draws right.
         C or 3 - draws down and right.
         X or 2 - draws down.
         Z or 1 - draws down and left.
         A or 4 - draws left.
         S or 5 - changes drawing color.
          
         F2 - Draw Line - Lets you draw a line on the graphic screen
         between two points. After the first X and Y coordinates, you
         can enter either relative or absolute coordinates. To enter
         relative coordinates, precede coordinates with '+' or '-'
         signs.

         F3 - Draw Lines - Lets you draw many lines on the graphic
         screen. After the first X and Y coordinates, you can enter
         either relative or absolute coordinates. Press the ENTER key
         when you are finished drawing the last line.
          
         F4 - Draw Frame - Lets you draw a frame on the graphics
         screen. After the first X and Y coordinates, you can enter
         either relative or absolute coordinates.
          
         F5 - Draw Box - Lets you draw a box on the graphics screen.
         After the first X and Y coordinate, you can enter either
         relative or absolute coordinates.
          
         F6 - Draw Circle - Lets you draw a circle on the graphic
         screen. This command accepts absolute coordinates only.
          
         F7 - Draw Disc - Lets you draw a disc on the graphic screen.
         This command accepts absolute coordinates only.
          
         F8 - Draw Arc - Lets you draw an arc on the graphic screen.
         This command accepts absolute coordinates only. If you
         precede the starting or ending angles with a '-' sign, the
         command draws a line from the center to the radius of the
         arc.
          
         F9 - Paint Object - Lets you paint an object on the graphic
         screen. Be sure the border is closed and in one color. If you
         precede the painting color with a '$' sign and type it in
         four-digit hexadecimal, you can paint the object in 256
         colors.
          
         F10 -This Menu -Displays the menu of drawing commands.
          
         SHIFT-F1 - Get Object - Lets you get an object so that you
         can put it somewhere else on the graphic screen.  After the
         first X and Y coordinates, you can enter relative or absolute
         coordinates.
          
         SHIFT-F2 - Put Object -Lets you put the object you got on the
         graphic screen. This command is useful for drawing circuit
         boards.
          
         SHIFT-F3 - Type Characters - Lets you type characters on the
         graphic screen. You are asked for the column, row, and color.
         To type characters without erasing the background, add 128 to
         the color number. Type a message on the screen using any
         characters between ASCII 32 and ASCII 127.
          
         SHIFT-F4 - Erase Mistake - Lets you erase any mistake that
         you make.

         SHIFT-F5 - Save Picture - Lets you save a graphic screen to
         disk. You are asked for the filename. Do not add any
         extensions because the program automatically adds '.PIC' to
         the filename.
          
         SHIFT-F6 - Load Picture - Lets you load a graphic screen from
         disk.
          
         SHIFT-F7 - Clear Screen - Lets you clear the graphic screen.
          
         SHIFT-F8 - Calculator - Lets you do simple math with a
         calculator. Press the ENTER key to return to the drawing
         command prompt.
          
         SHIFT-F9 - Return to BASIC - Lets you quit the BASIC drawing
         program and return to BASIC.
          
         SHIFT-F10 - Print Picture - Lets you print out a graphic
         screen on the printer.
          
         If you find the program useful, I suggest that you send me a
         check for $10. You can make copies of the program and manual
         and give them to other people. I wrote this program because I
         could not find a good drawing program for my Tandy 1000
         computer that does not require a joystick or a mouse or a
         touch pad or a light pen that uses the graphics screen mode
         of 320 X 200 in 16 colors.
