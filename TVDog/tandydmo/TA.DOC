		Features.  I find knowing how to access these things
		usefull because I can now make better programs.  
		All you have to do is copy these programs onto a disk 
		with TANDY GW-BASIC.  I use 3.20.  You may or may not 
		be able to use a smaller version.  After the BASIC is
		on the disk, type at the dos prompt:

				BASIC
		
		Now BASIC will load.  Next type:
			
				LOAD "TGA"

		The graphics demo is now loaded.  You can type:
			
					LIST
	
		to list the program or:
		
					RUN

		to run the program.  To use the sound demo program, 
		type:

			LOAD "TSA"

		this will load the Tandy Sound Chip demo.
