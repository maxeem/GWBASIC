Included with this package is a data file called WhizCall.DAT

This file is useful for demonstration and learning purposes. It may also be used as a "base file" by deleting and modifying records to suit your own needs. A more practical approach in most cases will be to simply delete this demo file and start afresh. WhizCall is designed to act accordingly -- if no WhizCall.DAT file is found on start up, an empty skeleton file will be created automatically.

In the event that you decide upon a new file, it would be wise to explicitly delete the one included with this package. Having two different files known by the same name is always a bad idea. The risk is simply too great that a "real file" might be overwritten by the "other one." Caveat. TM
