CryoGram consists of  27+ files that require nearly 3.5 Megs of disk storage space. Installation is straightforward: Move CryoGramX.EXE to a folder of your own choosing then click this file to unzip it. To run the program click on CryoGram.EXE.

CryoGram does not fool with the Windows system registry. To delete this application from your computer simply delete the folder containing all of its parts.

To save disk space, the original shipping package called CryoGramX.EXE may be deleted. Once unzipped, this file itself is no longer needed.

CryoGram was written in Just BASIC. The source file is called CryoGram.BAS. This is a TXT file that may be interesting reading to some. It is not needed in the run-time environment, however, and may be deleted.

CryoGram.TKN is the object program that is executed by CryoGram.EXE, the re-named Just BASIC run-time engine. The DLL and SLL files are also needed by the run time engine. The WAV, MID and BMP files are referenced by the parent CryoGram.TKN program and must all be resident in the same folder as the EXE and TKN files.

Good luck and have fun. TM
