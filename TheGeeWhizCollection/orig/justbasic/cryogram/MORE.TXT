As shipped originally, CryoGram includes 199 cryptograms. More and different cryptograms may be added by anyone. Care must be taken, however, to adhere to certain rules about the file called CryoGram.txt.

As a file, Cryogram.txt is more properly called a relative (or RANDOM) file. In this sense, each cryptogram is one record. TXT was chosen as a name because the file actually contains only text-type data, and it can be viewed and modified with nearly any text editor or word processing program.

1. A cryptogram is always and only 192 characters, including spaces.

2. A cryptogram must be organized such that the data stream may be output as 6 lines, each containing 32 characters. Note: No line terminators may be contained within the data stream. When displayed, line breaks are automatically inserted after every 32 characters.

3. A cryptogram may consist of only upper case letters of the alphabet, spaces, or any of the following punctuation characters: ! " _ ( ) , - . / : ; ? As used here, the underscore character (_) will be interpreted and displayed as a long dash, same as is most often used as a prefix for author's names.

That's it. Know, however, if any of the above rules are bent, the results may be chaotic. CryoGram contains no logic to deal with aberrations. Caveat. And have fun. TM
