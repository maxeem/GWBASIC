Running WhizNews with Windows:

WhizNews should be started from a Windows shortcut with "properties" set up as below.


  Program tab - Working path must be the same as for Cmd line.

  Screen tab --  Full screen, Restore settings on startup

  Misc tab - Allow screen saver = NO

If started as a separate task, WNeditor should also be set up this same way.  Although Wnhelp.COM can be started by simply "clicking on it", it too ought to be started with a shortcut setup as above if you want to run it as a standalone job.

Although documented in WNhelp, here is the same advice:  The recommended way to get to the editor (and thus, to help) is to hold down an <Alt> key and punch 149 on the numeric key pad.  This will cause the show to stop immediately, and control is transferred to the editor with the page then being displayed already loaded into the editing buffer.  To get to the editor's menu at that point, simply hit <F1>.  And <Esc> from there will resume the show, of course.  Enjoy, please.  TM
