10 ' ABSTRACT: Some of you may have tried the SPOOLER Programs on this disk,
20 '		and found that the spooler no longer operated when you moved
30 ' 		from DOS to BASIC.  This BASIC program allows you to continue
40 '		printing to the spooler created by one of the SPOOLER programs
50 '		after you have started you BASIC Language.

120 'This program is contributed to the Boston Computer Society's IBM User's
130 'Group for the personal and educational use of its members.  The program
140 'is not to be used for commercial gain.
150 ' INSTRUCTIONS: AFTER starting the spooler program by typing SPOOLER1 or
160 ' SPOOLER2 from DOS, and moving into BASIC Language, simply type:
170 '				RUN "spoolbas <cr>
180 ' The spooler's operation will then be extended into your BASIC operations.
190 '
200 ' The program restores the timer interrupt vector to what was set by spooler.
210 ' Because BASIC changes this vector to service light pen and joystick
220 ' interfaces, this program will disable those features.  Programs that
230 ' do not use joysticks or light pens will not be affected.
240 ' Repeat!!, only run this program from BASIC AFTER one of the spoolers 
250 ' have been executed.
