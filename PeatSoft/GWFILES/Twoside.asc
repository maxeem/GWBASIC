10 '           Basic program       TWOSIDE.BAS         3-6-82
20 '
30 '  This program creates the file TWOSIDE.COM which, when executed,
40 '  makes changes to DOS that allows formatting (and addressing) the
50 '  other side of disks "A" and "B" as "C" and "D" respectively.
60 '  Of course, you must have two-sided drives installed such as Tandon 100-2.
70 '
80 '  The author has placed no restrictions upon use of this program.
90 '
100 '  Installation and use:
110 '   1. Initialize BASIC
120 '   2. Load (or create) the program file (this program) TWOSIDE.BAS
130 '   3. Enter --> RUN           (this creates the file TWOSIDE.COM)
140 '   4. Set system board switch #1 diskette selection positions to
150 '      the number of physical and logical drives that you have installed.
160 '      For example, if you have two physical drives installed and the
170 '      TWOSIDE option will add two logical drives, set the switch selection
180 '      positions for 4 drives (position 1, 7, & 8 off).
190 '   5. Before addressing disks "C" or "D" -- After system initialization
200 '      ENTER --> TWOSIDE
210 '   6. If you wish, the AUTOEXEC.BAT file may be used to cause the TWOSIDE
220 '      command to execute automatically when the system is brought up.
